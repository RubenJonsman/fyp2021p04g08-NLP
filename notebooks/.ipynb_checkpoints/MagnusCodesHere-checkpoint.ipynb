above 10,000.', 'Now that gold has crossed the magic $1,000 barrier, why can‚Äôt it increase ten-fold, too?', 'Admittedly, getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems.', 'After adjusting for inflation, today‚Äôs price is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980.', 'Back then, gold hit $850, or well over $2,000 in today‚Äôs dollars.', 'But January 1980 was arguably a ‚Äúfreak peak‚Äù during a period of heightened geo-political instability.', 'At $1,300, today‚Äôs price is probably more than double very long-term, inflation-adjusted, average gold prices.', 'So what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here?', 'One answer, of course, is a complete collapse of the US dollar.', 'With soaring deficits, and a rudderless fiscal policy, one does wonder whether a populist administration might recklessly turn to the printing press.', 'And if you are really worried about that, gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge.', 'Sure, some might argue that inflation-indexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold.', 'But gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances.', 'In fact, as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises, This Time is Different, cash-strapped governments will often forcibly convert indexed debt to non-indexed debt, precisely so that its value might be inflated away.', 'Even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930‚Äôs.', 'So it can happen anywhere.', 'Even so, the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it probable, so one should be cautious in arguing that higher gold prices are being driven by inflation expectations.', 'Some have argued instead that gold‚Äôs long upward march has been partly driven by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to trade and speculate in gold.', 'There is probably some slight truth ‚Äì and also a certain degree of irony ‚Äì to this argument.', 'After all, medieval alchemists engaged in what we now consider an absurd search for ways to transform base metals into gold.', 'Wouldn‚Äôt it be paradoxical, then, if financial alchemy could make an ingot of gold worth dramatically more?', 'In my view, the most powerful argument to justify today‚Äôs high price of gold is the dramatic emergence of Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East into the global economy.', 'As legions of new consumers gain purchasing power, demand inevitably rises, driving up the price of scarce commodities.', 'At the same time, emerging-market central banks need to accumulate gold reserves, which they still hold in far lower proportion than do rich-country central banks.', 'With the euro looking less appetizing as a diversification play away from the dollar, gold‚Äôs appeal has naturally grown.', 'So, yes, there are solid fundamentals that arguably support today‚Äôs higher gold price, although it is far more debatable whether and to what extent they will continue to support higher prices in the future.', 'Indeed, another critical fundamental factor that has been sustaining high gold prices might prove far more ephemeral than globalization.', 'Gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interest-rate movements.', 'After all, gold pays no interest and even costs something to store.', 'Today, with interest rates near or at record lows in many countries, it is relatively cheap to speculate in gold instead of investing in bonds.', 'But if real interest rates rise significantly, as well they might someday, gold prices could plummet.', 'Most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict over the short to medium term, with the odds of gains and losses being roughly in balance.', 'It is therefore dangerous to extrapolate from short-term trends.', 'Yes, gold has had a great run, but so, too, did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago.', 'If you are a high-net-worth investor, a sovereign wealth fund, or a central bank, it makes perfect sense to hold a modest proportion of your portfolio in gold as a hedge against extreme events.', 'But, despite gold‚Äôs heightened allure in the wake of an extraordinary run-up in its price, it remains a very risky bet for most of us.', 'Of course, such considerations might have little influence on prices.', 'What was true for the alchemists of yore remains true today: gold and reason are often difficult to reconcile.', '', '‚ÄúOur‚Äù Islamists', 'NEW DELHI ‚Äì Following the death of Libya‚Äôs Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya‚Äôs interim government announced the ‚Äúliberation‚Äù of the country.', 'It also declared that a system based on sharia (Islamic law), including polygamy, would replace the secular dictatorship that Qaddafi ran for 42 years.', 'Swapping one form of authoritarianism for another seems a cruel letdown after seven months of NATO airstrikes in the name of democracy.', 'In fact, the Western powers that brought about regime change in Libya have made little effort to prevent its new rulers from establishing a theocracy.', 'But this is the price that the West willingly pays in exchange for the privilege of choosing the new leadership.', 'Indeed, the cloak of Islam helps to protect the credibility of leaders who might otherwise be seen as foreign puppets.', 'For the same reason, the West has condoned the rulers of the oil sheikhdoms for their longstanding alliance with radical clerics.', 'For example, the decadent House of Saud, backed by the United States, not only practices Wahhabi Islam ‚Äì the source of modern Islamic fundamentalism ‚Äì but also exports this fringe form of the faith, gradually snuffing out more liberal Islamic traditions.', 'Yet, when the Saudi Crown Prince died recently, the US stood by silently as the ruling family appointed its most reactionary Islamist as the new heir to the throne.', 'So intrinsic have the Arab monarchs become to US interests that the Americans have failed to stop these cloistered royals from continuing to fund Muslim extremist groups and madrasas in other countries.', 'From Africa to South and Southeast Asia, Arab petrodollars have played a key role in fomenting militant Islamic fundamentalism that targets the West, Israel, and India as its enemies.', 'The US interest in maintaining pliant regimes in oil-rich countries trumps all other considerations.', 'With Western support, the oil monarchies, even the most tyrannical, have been able to ride out the Arab Spring, emerging virtually unscathed.', 'For the US, the sheikhdoms that make up the Gulf Cooperation Council ‚Äì Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman ‚Äì are critical for geostrategic reasons as well.', 'After withdrawing its forces from Iraq, the US is considering using Kuwait as a new military hub to expand its military presence in the Persian Gulf region and foster a US-led ‚Äúsecurity architecture,‚Äù under which its air and naval patrols would be regionally integrated.', 'NATO-led regime change in Libya ‚Äì which holds the world‚Äôs largest reserves of the light sweet crude oil that American and European refineries prefer ‚Äì was not really about

rather than short-term victories.', 'The Obama administration‚Äôs current effort to strike a Faustian bargain with the Taliban, for example, ignores America‚Äôs own experience of the consequences of following the path of expediency.', 'Another lesson that has been ignored is the need for caution in training Islamic insurgents and funneling lethal arms to them to help overthrow a regime.', 'In Libya, bringing the myriad rebel militias under government control is likely to prove difficult, potentially creating a jihadist citadel at Europe‚Äôs southern doorstep.', 'Exponents of US policy argue that in war it is sometimes necessary to choose the lesser of two evils.', 'Unsavory allies ‚Äì ranging from Islamist militias to regimes that bankroll militant Islamic fundamentalism overseas ‚Äì may be an unavoidable price to be paid in the service of larger interests.', 'Paradoxically, the US practice of propping up malleable Islamist rulers in the Middle East often results in strong anti-US sentiment, as well as support for more independent and ‚Äúauthentically‚Äù Islamist forces.', 'When elections are held, it is such autonomous Islamists who often emerge as winners, as in Gaza

behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional.', 'The tendency is either excessive restraint (Europe) or a diffusion of the effort (the United States).', 'Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro, whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms.', 'For geo-strategists, however, the year that naturally comes to mind, in both politics and economics, is 1989.', 'Of course, the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall.',

ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points.', 'And what happens in 2009 may jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989, including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist, if not xenophobic, tendencies.', 'In 1989, liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc.', 'For many of his supporters, it was President Ronald Reagan who, with his deliberate escalation of the arms race, pushed the Soviet economy to the brink, thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets.', 'Of course, there are obvious differences between 1989 and now.', 'First, and perhaps above all, the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity.', 'By contrast, 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity, but with China substituting for the Soviet Union.', 'Second, whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear ‚Äì if more fragile than expected ‚Äì winners in 1989, it is difficult in 2009, with the spread of the global crisis, to distinguish

segment of the population ‚Äì emigrated to Western Europe.', 'As Krastev and Holmes show, those left behind have increasingly compared their own prospects not to those of their parents, but to the lucky elite who resettled to live the Western dream.', 'This has led to widespread frustration and anger toward the post-communist class of liberal reformers in Central and Eastern Europe.', 'Not only did these Western-oriented elites fail to meet the unrealistic expectations of Western imitation; they also allowed for a mass exodus of talent.', 'When the refugee crisis erupted in 2015, it fed into

model relies on a one-party leadership‚Äôs ability to learn and adapt its agenda accordingly.', 'For a country as large and diverse as China, this approach makes sense, as it balances stability with flexibility.', 'The country‚Äôs development is guided not by outcomes in decentralized markets, but by the choices of a central government, which presides over the provision of public goods, sets rules, and manages institutions.', 'In order to avoid the types of social disruption that political competition could entail, the central government also appoints key provincial and municipal officials and resolves disputes among regions.', 'Meanwhile, regional and municipal governments engage in policy experimentation at the local level, where markets and communities interact, with the results of those experiments informing national policy.', 'Regional competition not only fuels overall economic growth; it also ensures that the particular needs of each area, from megacities like Beijing to the tiny villages that dot China‚Äôs countryside, are met.', 'As the situation on the ground changes, with new solutions often creating new and unforeseeable problems, continual adaptation at every level is vital.', 'Of course, the predominance of the state does not mean that markets do not have an important role to play.', 'But that role is often misunderstood.', 'In recent decades, China used state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to build key infrastructure, in order to support the development of China‚Äôs markets.', 'Today, SOEs still play an important role in social engineering and research and development, but their business models are under pressure from globalization and disruptive technologies.', 'That is why Xi has included in his plan measures to support the continued opening of markets, including the use of competition law to enable markets to dictate prices, improve resource allocation, and boost productivity.', 'But market liberalization, in a context of globalization and rapid technological change, has also given rise to another potentially damaging trend: the emergence of a few ultra-dominant tech giants.', 'Moreover, market liberalization has often outpaced progress in regulation and enforcement, allowing for abuses like speculation and tax avoidance.', 'Given this, China‚Äôs government has, in recent years, strengthened regulation and enforcement in virtually all sectors.', 'It is this apparent contradiction ‚Äì between the stated objective of liberalizing markets and the reality of tightened regulations ‚Äì that seems to confuse outsiders.', 'But the fact is that rising social imbalances can be addressed only by effective government intervention that avoids state capture or the kind of paralysis that can arise from excessive political competition.', 'Another seemingly contradictory element of Xi‚Äôs plan is its insistence on party leadership in all national affairs, alongside a pledge to strengthen the rule of law.', 'But, again, a closer look reveals a straightforward logic: the transition to a future in which the rule of law is paramount will require China to overcome its legacy of bureaucratic silos that entrench resistance to reform from vested interests.', 'Doing so will demand strong leadership.', 'In a world comprising a diverse array of countries, each with its own complex, dynamic, and evolving system, there can be no one-size-fits-all development path.', 'Though countries may all aspire toward similar lifestyles, business environments, and social systems, they will get there in their own way, determined according to their particular needs, preferences, structures, and legacies.', 'For China, that way has now been mapped, with the understanding that the map can and will be revised as needed.', '', 'One Hundred Years of Ineptitude', 'BERLIN ‚Äì The global financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 was the greatest economic stress-test since the Great Depression, and the greatest challenge to social and political systems since World War II.', 'It not only put financial markets and currencies at risk; it also exposed serious regulatory and governance shortcomings that have yet to be fully addressed.', 'In fact, the 2008 crisis will most likely be remembered as a watershed moment, but not because it led to reforms that strengthened economic resilience and removed vulnerabilities.', 'On the contrary, leaders‚Äô failure to discern, much less act on, the lessons of the Great Recession may open the way for a series of fresh crises, economic and otherwise, in the coming decades.', 'However serious those crises turn out to be, historians a century from now will likely despair at our shortsightedness.', 'They will note that analysts and regulators were narrowly focused on fixing the financial system by strengthening national oversight regimes.', 'While this was a worthy goal, historians will point out, it was far from the only imperative.', 'To prepare the world to confront the challenges posed by globalization and technological development in a way that supports sustainable and equitable growth, governance institutions and regulations at both the national and international levels must be drastically improved.', 'Yet not nearly enough has been invested in this effort.', 'Beyond regional bodies like the European Union, international financial governance has remained largely untouched.', 'Worse, because the partial fixes to the financial system will enable even more globalization, they will end up making matters worse, as strain on already-inadequate governance and regulatory frameworks increases, not only in finance, but also in other economic and technological fields.', 'Meanwhile, enormous financial investments focused on securing a higher rate of return are likely to fuel technological innovation, further stressing regulatory systems in finance and beyond.', 'Major technological advances fueled by cheap money can cause markets to change so fast that policy and institutional change cannot keep up.', 'And new markets can emerge that offer huge payoffs for early adopters or investors, who benefit from remaining several steps ahead of national and international regulators.', 'This is what happened in the run-up to the 2008 crisis.', 'New technology-enabled financial instruments created opportunities for some to make huge amounts of money.', 'But regulators were unable to keep up with the innovations, which ended up generating risks that affected the entire economy.', 'This points to a fundamental difference between global crises of the twenty-first century and, say, the Great Depression in the 1930s or, indeed, any past stock-market crashes.', 'Because of the financial sector‚Äôs growth, more actors benefit from under-regulation and weak governance in the short term, making today‚Äôs crises more difficult to prevent.', 'Complicating matters further, the systems affected by today‚Äôs crises extend well beyond any one regulatory body‚Äôs jurisdiction.', 'That makes crises far unrulier, and their consequences ‚Äì including their long-term influence on societies and politics ‚Äì more difficult to predict.', 'The next crises ‚Äì made more likely by rising nationalism and a growing disregard for science and fact-based policymaking ‚Äì may be financial, but they could also implicate realms as varied as migration, trade, cyberspace, pollution, and climate change.', 'In all of these areas, national and international governance institutions are weak or incomplete, and there are few independent actors, such as watchdog groups, demanding transparency and accountability.', 'This makes it harder not only to prevent crises ‚Äì not least because it creates opportunities for actors to game the system and shirk responsibility ‚Äì but also to respond to them.', 'The 2008 crisis cast a harsh spotlight on just how bad we are at responding quickly to disasters, especially those fueled by fragmented governance.', 'To be sure, as the Hertie School‚Äôs 2018 Governance Report shows, there have been some improvements in preparing for and managing crises.', 'But we must become more alert to how developments in a wide range of fields ‚Äì from finance to digital technologies and climate change ‚Äì can elude the governance capacities of national and international institutions.', 'We should be running crisis scenarios and preparing emergency plans for upheaval in all of these fields, and taking stronger steps to mitigate risks, including by managing debt levels, which today remain much higher in the advanced economies than they were before the 2008 crisis.', 'Moreover, we should ensure that we provide international institutions with the needed resources and responsibilities.', 'And by punishing those who exacerbate risks for the sake of their own interests, we would strengthen the legitimacy of global governance and the institutions that are meant to conduct it.', 'As it stands, inadequate cross-border coordination and enforcement of international agreements is a major impediment to crisis prevention and management.', 'Yet, far from addressing this weakness, the world is reviving an outdated model of national sovereignty that makes crises of various kinds more likely.', 'Unless we change course soon, the world of 2118 will have much reason to regard us with scorn.', '', 'What Failed in 2008?', 'BERKELEY ‚Äì To solve a problem, it is not enough to know what to do.', 'You actually have to implement the solution ‚Äì and be willing to change course if it turns out that you did not know quite as much as you thought.', 'That is the message of two recent books that, together, tell you everything you need to know about the 2008 financial crisis: what caused it, what can be done to prevent it from recurring, and why those things have yet to be done.', 'The first book is The Shifts and the Shocks, by the conservative British journalist Martin Wolf, who begins by cataloguing the major shifts that set the stage for the economic disaster that continues to shape the world today.', 'His starting point is the huge rise in wealth among the world‚Äôs richest 0.1% and 0.01% and the consequent pressure for people, governments, and companies to take on increasingly unsustainable levels of debt.', 'Meanwhile, policymakers were lulled into complacency by the widespread acceptance of economic theories such as the ‚Äúefficient-market hypothesis,‚Äù which assumes that investors act rationally and use all available information when making their decisions.', 'As a result, markets were deregulated, making it easier to trade assets that were perceived to be safe, but were in fact not.', 'As a result, systemic risk proliferated beyond central bankers‚Äô wildest imagination.', 'Untested ‚Äì and ultimately incorrect ‚Äì assumptions created a policymaking environment defined by what can only be called hubris.', 'Officials underestimated tail risks.', 'They set inflation targets at around 2% ‚Äì leaving little room for maneuver when the water got choppy.', 'And, most audaciously of all, the European Union introduced the euro as a common currency.', 'Indeed, wrongheaded policymaking continued long after the crisis began.', 'Politicians responded to worsening economic conditions by hewing as closely as possible to failed prescriptions, making sure to do no more than absolutely necessary to address the biggest economic disaster since the Great Depression.', 'Wolf‚Äôs prescription for countering the crisis is simple, smart, and unassailable.', 'In the short term, he suggests that countries with reserve currencies spend more (especially to finance public-sector investments) and issue more debt.', 'Their central banks, he argues, should raise inflation targets to 3% or even 4% per year.', 'Over the medium term, according to Wolf, countries need to put in place regulatory measures that lower debt levels and discourage overleveraging.', 'The eurozone, too, must resolve its internal contradictions, either by disbanding or by introducing ‚Äúa minimum set of institutions and policies‚Äù that allow the monetary union to function properly.', 'Wolf‚Äôs long-term solutions include tackling inequality, ‚Äúmore global regulation,‚Äù a greater degree of ‚Äúfreedom for individual countries to craft their own responses,‚Äù and economic analysis that is less in thrall to the free-market ideologues that led us into the crisis in the first place.', 'And yet, as recommendable as Wolf‚Äôs proposals may be, little has been done to implement them.', 'The reasons why are found in the second book: Hall of Mirrors, by my friend, teacher, and patron, Barry Eichengreen.', 'Eichengreen traces our tepid response to the crisis to the triumph of monetarist economists, the disciples of Milton Friedman, over their Keynesian and Minskyite peers ‚Äì at least when it comes to interpretations of the causes and consequences of the Great Depression.', 'When the 2008 financial crisis erupted, policymakers tried to apply Friedman‚Äôs proposed solutions to the Great Depression.', 'Unfortunately, this turned out to be the wrong thing to do, as the monetarist interpretation of the Great Depression was, to put it bluntly, wrong in significant respects and radically incomplete.', 'The resulting policies were enough to prevent the post-2008 recession from developing into a full-blown depression; but that partial success turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory, for it allowed politicians to declare that the crisis had been overcome, and that it was time to embrace austerity and focus on structural reform.', 'The result is today‚Äôs stagnant economy, marked by anemic growth that threatens to become the new normal.', 'The United States and Europe are on track to have thrown away 10% of their potential wealth, while the failure to strengthen financial-sector regulation has left the world economy exposed to the risk of another major crisis.', 'Wolf and Eichengreen would agree that the main shortcomings that led to the 2008 financial crisis ‚Äì and that continue to underpin our inadequate response to it ‚Äì are intellectual.', 'Indeed, the only true lesson of the crisis so far seems to be that its lessons will never truly be learned.', '', 'Loser Teens', 'PRINCETON ‚Äì We are at the end of a decade that has

headway, while anti-globalization groups seized control of the public discourse, presenting the TTIP as a threat to everything from Europe‚Äôs democracy to its health.', 'This is dangerously inaccurate talk, and EU leaders must prevent it from gaining any more traction by making the strategic case for the agreement.', 'And they must revive their commitment to conclude the talks successfully in 2015.', 'This is not to say that resolving the remaining issues in the TTIP negotiations will be simple.', 'But establishing a trade agreement, especially one that entails so many regulatory issues, is always difficult, as it must account for the complexity and changeability of modern economies.', 'The fact is that the challenges inherent in completing the TTIP are no more intractable than those that EU leaders have faced in the last few years of crisis.', 'When the TTIP negotiations resume next month, EU leaders must push for genuine progress, with the goal of completing a deal by the end of the year.', 'The good news is that the recent midterm elections in the US might have improved their chances.', 'President Barack Obama now might get so-called

Russia and Iran, have retaken almost all of Aleppo ‚Äì once Syria‚Äôs largest city, now utterly devastated by the war.', 'The world‚Äôs priority for the coming year must be to achieve peace in Syria, which will require close regional and international cooperation.', 'On December 27, Iran, Russia, and Turkey will hold a tripartite meeting in Moscow to discuss a political solution for the Syria conflict.', 'That meeting, if it takes place, is likely to be overshadowed by the fallout from the assassination of Russia‚Äôs ambassador to Turkey.', 'But it is nothing if not surprising that these parties, and not the US and the European Union, would be negotiating such an agreement.', 'One positive development this year came in March, when the EU and Turkey signed an agreement to address the refugee crisis.', 'Turkey has now taken in some three million Syrian refugees since the beginning of the conflict.', 'Although EU-Turkey relations are currently not at their best, the dialogue between the two sides must continue in 2017, not least because of their common interests, which are based not only on economic interdependence, but also on the refugee crisis and the collective fight against terrorism.', 'European politics next year, meanwhile, will be consumed by the Brexit negotiations.', 'In March, the United Kingdom will likely invoke Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, triggering the formal procedure for withdrawal from the EU.', 'The challenge will be to reach an agreement that guarantees the wellbeing of future EU-UK relations.', 'This will not be easy, and EU negotiators have already set a timeline of only 18 months.', 'While much remains uncertain, what is clear is that if the UK wants to retain access to the European single market, it will have to accept the EU‚Äôs four freedoms, including the free movement of workers.', 'In 2017, several European countries will hold general elections, and there is a risk that isolationist, anti-European populist movements will make a strong showing.', 'For the EU to lose a country as militarily and economically important as the UK is bad enough; but to lose a founding EU member state, such as France, would be tragic.', 'Fortunately, many Europeans‚Äô views toward the EU actually improved in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.', 'But this will not lessen the challenge for EU governments in the year ahead.', 'They must unite societies divided by powerful global forces, such as globalization and rapid technological innovation.', 'The Brexit referendum, followed by Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the US presidential election, signaled the rise of populism in the West.', 'But now that Trump is filling his cabinet with oligarchs and former military men, we have reason to doubt that he will keep his promise to govern without the Washington ‚Äúestablishment.‚Äù', 'Trump‚Äôs incoming administration is full of unknowns, but there can be no doubt that his rejection of multilateral institutions will endanger international efforts to cooperate on solutions to the world‚Äôs biggest problems.', 'This holds peril for US-EU relations.', 'In previous years, the Paris climate agreement and the nuclear agreement with Iran were rays of light in a world closing itself off to multilateralism.', 'In the coming years, such rays may become scarcer still.', 'Now more than ever, we need the kind of dialogue that builds strategic trust between great powers.', 'And yet, Trump‚Äôs statements casting doubt on continued US adherence to a ‚ÄúOne China‚Äù policy vis-√†-vis Taiwan could severely damage relations between the world‚Äôs two largest economies.', 'Similarly, notwithstanding the pro-Russian leanings of some among Trump‚Äôs team, the US-Russian relationship also lacks strategic trust, owing to Russia‚Äôs military intervention in Syria, its invasion of eastern Ukraine, and its alleged interference in the US election.', 'The coming year will be particularly important for Europe.', 'Relations

2017 is shaping up to be a year of challenges and uncertainty.', 'But the biggest uncertainty of all is whether this is simply the end of another year, or the end of a geopolitical epoch.', '', 'Another Slow Year for the Global Economy', 'WASHINGTON, DC ‚Äì Last April, the International Monetary Fund projected that the world economy would grow by 3.5% in 2015.', 'In the ensuing months, that forecast was steadily whittled down, reaching 3.1% in October.', 'But the IMF continues to insist ‚Äì as it has, with almost banal predictability, for the last seven years ‚Äì that next year will be better.', 'But it is almost certainly wrong yet again.', 'For starters, world trade is growing at an anemic annual rate of 2%, compared to 8% from 2003 to 2007.', 'Whereas trade growth during those heady years far exceeded that of world GDP, which averaged 4.5%, lately, trade and GDP growth rates have been about the same.', 'Even if GDP growth outstrips growth in trade this year, it will likely amount to no more than 2.7%.', 'The question is why.', 'According to Christina and David Romer of the University of California, Berkeley, the aftershocks of modern financial crises ‚Äì that is, since World War II ‚Äì fade after 2-3 years.', 'The Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff say that it takes five years for a country to dig itself out of a financial crisis.', 'And, indeed, the financial dislocations of 2007-2008 have largely receded.', 'So what accounts for the sluggish economic recovery?', 'One popular explanation lies in the fuzzy notion of ‚Äúsecular stagnation‚Äù: long-term depressed demand for goods and services is undermining incentives to invest and hire.', 'But demand would remain weak only if people lacked confidence in the future.', 'The only logical explanation for this enduring lack of confidence, as Northwestern University‚Äôs Robert Gordon has painstakingly documented and argued, is slow productivity growth.', 'Before the crisis ‚Äì and especially from 2003 to 2007 ‚Äì slow productivity growth was being obscured by an illusory sense of prosperity in much of the world.', 'In some countries ‚Äì notably, the United States, Spain, and Ireland ‚Äì rising real-estate prices, speculative construction, and financial risk-taking were mutually reinforcing.', 'At the same time, countries were amplifying one another‚Äôs growth through trade.', 'Central to the global boom was China, the rising giant that flooded the world with cheap exports, putting a lid on global inflation.', 'Equally important, China imported a huge volume of commodities, thereby bolstering many African and Latin American economies, and purchased German cars and machines, enabling Europe‚Äôs largest economy to keep its regional supply chains humming.', 'This dynamic reversed around March 2008, when the US rescued its fifth-largest investment bank, Bear Sterns, from collapse.', 'With the eurozone banks also deeply implicated in the subprime mortgage mess and desperately short of US dollars, America and much of Europe began a remorseless slide into recession.', 'Whereas in the boom years, world trade had spread the bounty, it was now spreading the malaise.', 'As each country‚Äôs GDP growth slowed, so did its imports, causing its trading partners‚Äô growth to slow as well.', 'The US economy began to emerge from its recession in the second half of 2009, thanks largely to aggressive monetary policy and steps to stabilize the financial system.', 'Eurozone policymakers, by contrast, rejected monetary stimulus and implemented fiscal austerity measures, while ignoring the deepening distress of their banks.', 'The eurozone thus pushed the world into a second global recession.', 'Just when that recession seemed to have run its course, emerging economies began to unravel.', 'For years, observers had been touting the governance and growth-enhancing reforms that these countries‚Äô leaders had supposedly introduced.', 'In October 2012, the IMF celebrated emerging economies‚Äô ‚Äúresilience.‚Äù', 'As if on cue, that facade began to crumble, revealing an inconvenient truth: factors like high commodity prices and massive capital inflows had been concealing serious economic weaknesses, while legitimizing a culture of garish inequality and rampant corruption.', 'These problems are now being compounded by the growth slowdown in China, the fulcrum of global trade.', 'And the worst is yet to come.', 'China‚Äôs huge industrial overcapacity and property glut needs to be wound down; the hubris driving its global acquisitions must be reined in; and its corruption networks have to be dismantled.', 'In short, the factors that dragged down the global economy in 2015 will persist ‚Äì and in some cases even intensify ‚Äì in the new year.', 'Emerging economies will remain weak.', 'The eurozone, having enjoyed a temporary reprieve from austerity, will be constrained by listless global trade.', 'Rising interest rates on corporate bonds portend slower growth in the US.', 'China‚Äôs collapsing asset values could trigger financial turbulence.', 'And policymakers are adrift, with little political leverage to stem these trends.', 'The IMF should stop forecasting renewed growth and issue a warning that the global economy will remain weak and vulnerable unless world leaders act energetically to spur innovation and growth.', 'Such an effort is long overdue.', '', 'Trumpian Uncertainty', 'NEW YORK ‚Äì Every January, I try to craft a forecast for the coming year.', 'Economic forecasting is notoriously difficult; but, notwithstanding the truth expressed in Harry Truman‚Äôs request for a one-armed economist (who wouldn‚Äôt be able to say ‚Äúon the other hand‚Äù), my record has been credible.', 'In recent years, I correctly foresaw that, in the absence of stronger fiscal stimulus (which was not forthcoming in either Europe or the United States), recovery from the Great Recession of 2008 would be slow.', 'In making these forecasts, I have relied more on analysis of underlying economic forces than on complex econometric models.', 'For example, at the beginning of 2016, it seemed clear that the deficiencies of global aggregate demand that have been manifest for the last several years were unlikely to change dramatically.', 'Thus, I thought that forecasters of a stronger recovery were looking at the world through rose-tinted glasses.', 'Economic developments unfolded much as I anticipated.', 'Not so the political events of 2016.', 'I had been writing for years that unless growing inequality ‚Äì especially in the US, but also in many countries throughout the world ‚Äì was addressed, there would be political consequences.', 'But inequality continued to worsen ‚Äì with striking data showing that average life expectancy in the US was on the decline.', 'These results were foreshadowed by a study last year, by Anne Case and Angus Deaton, which showed that life expectancy was on the decline for large segments of the population ‚Äì including America‚Äôs so-called angry men of the Rust Belt.', 'But, with the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for very large swaths of the country.', 'And while America might be at the extreme of this trend, things were little better elsewhere.', 'But, if it seemed clear that there would be political consequences, their form and timing were far less obvious.', 'Why did the backlash in the US come just when the economy seemed to be on the mend, rather than earlier?', 'And why did it manifest itself in a lurch to the right?', 'After all, it was the Republicans who had blocked assistance to those losing their jobs as a result of the globalization they pushed assiduously.', 'It was the Republicans who, in 26 states, refused to allow the expansion of Medicaid, thereby denying health insurance to those at the bottom.', 'And why was the victor somebody who made his living from taking advantage of others, openly admitted not paying his fair share of taxes, and made tax avoidance a point of pride?', 'Donald Trump grasped the spirit of the time: things weren‚Äôt going well, and many voters wanted change.', 'Now they will get it: there will be no business as usual.', 'But seldom has there been more uncertainty.', 'Which policies Trump will pursue remains unknown, to say nothing of which will succeed or what the consequences will be.', 'Trump seems hell-bent on having a trade war.', 'But how will China and Mexico respond?', 'Trump may well understand that what he proposes will violate World Trade Organization rules, but he may also know that it will take a long time for the WTO to rule against him.', 'And by then, America‚Äôs trade account may have been rebalanced.', 'But two can play that game: China can take similar actions, though its response is likely to be more subtle.', 'If a trade war were to break out, what would happen?', 'Trump may have reason to think he could win; after all, China is more dependent on exports to the US than the US is on exports to China, which gives the US an advantage.', 'But a trade war is not a zero-sum game.', 'The US stands to lose as well.', 'China may be more effective in targeting its retaliation to cause acute political pain.', 'And the Chinese may be in a better position to respond to US attempts to inflict pain on them than the US is to respond to the pain that China might inflict on Americans.', 'It‚Äôs anybody‚Äôs guess who can stand the pain better.', 'Will it be the US, where ordinary citizens have already suffered for so long, or China, which, despite troubled times, has managed to generate growth in excess of 6%?', 'More broadly, the Republican/Trump agenda, with its tax cuts even more weighted toward the rich than the standard GOP recipe would imply, is based on the idea of trickle-down prosperity ‚Äì a continuation of the Reagan era‚Äôs supply-side economics, which never actually worked.', 'Fire-breathing rhetoric, or raving three a.m. tweets, may assuage the anger of those left behind by the Reagan revolution, at least for a while.', 'But for how long?', 'And what happens then?', 'Trump might like to repeal the ordinary laws of economics, as he goes about his version of voodoo economics.', 'But he can‚Äôt.', 'Still, as the world‚Äôs largest economy leads the way into uncharted political waters in 2017 and beyond, it would be foolhardy for a mere mortal to attempt a forecast, other than to state the obvious: the waters will almost certainly be choppy, and many ‚Äì if not most ‚Äì pundit ships will sink along the way.', '', 'Europe‚Äôs Coming Year of

policies in 2020, the radical right will continue to rise, and with it the trend toward increasing inequality, economic risks, and environmental degradation.', 'How we got to this point is not difficult to discern.', 'Four decades of neoliberal policies have eroded living conditions in most countries.', 'Governments of both the left and the right, advised by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other organizations, have been pursuing supply-side policies focused on improving business competitiveness, which has meant lower wages, more ‚Äúflexible‚Äù labor markets, lower corporate taxation, and greater income inequality.', 'While companies sharpened their competitive edge amid falling living standards and rising public debts, global demand has stagnated.', 'Governments have also pursued cuts in social expenditures and the privatization of public services.', 'Paradoxically, most of the savings from these cuts have gone toward supporting private companies with tax breaks and bailouts in an effort to generate growth.', 'Thus, the average citizen has experienced a significant decline in welfare, and growth has remained slow, because neoliberal short-term policies do not address the long-term structural causes of the problem: overproduction and excess capacity.', 'If the current course is not changed, austerity policies will continue spreading in 2020, cutting into pensions, wages, social programs, and labor protections.', 'In 2020, austerity will become ‚Äúthe new normal,‚Äù affecting 113 countries, or more than 70% of the world population, and fueling more social discontent.', 'Absurdly, many governments are cutting social expenditures, but increasing military spending and supporting large corporations with public funds and limited regulation.', 'At a time when half of the world‚Äôs population still lives in poverty (defined as less than $5.50 per day), this is likely to result in more protests and conflicts in 2020.', 'Austerity is not necessary.', 'Even in the poorest countries, there are alternatives.', 'The International Labor Organization, United Nations Women, and UNICEF report at least eight financing options to generate resources sustainably and avoid cuts to public services.', 'For example, countries can curb illicit financial flows, crack down on tax evasion, increase the progressivity of the tax system, reduce debt service by better managing debt, or adopt more accommodative macroeconomic frameworks.', 'There are many successful examples in recent times.', 'If governments were to opt out of austerity, we could see more countries successfully raising revenue for national development in 2020, increasing public investments that benefit people, and supporting real economic activity and human development, with a view toward generating decent employment and ensuring environmental sustainability.', 'In addition to improving financial regulation and redressing financialization processes, these policies would help avoid the danger of recession and the possible economic and financial crisis predicted by institutions such as the UN, J.P. Morgan, and Moody‚Äôs.', 'Even if the world avoids economic calamity in 2020, environmental devastation will continue.', 'The world is losing more than 26 million hectares of trees each year, an area the size of the UK, mostly tropical rainforests, affecting both climate and wildlife.', 'Unless adequate policies are implemented, deforestation, overfishing, carbon emissions, and waste generation are all expected to increase in absolute terms next year.', 'These are not just national issues.', 'Global problems require global solutions and multilateralism needs to be strengthened, not weakened, to work together to form sustainable solutions to improve people‚Äôs lives.', 'A better future for all is possible.', 'Governments, and ultimately citizens, can improve the world in 2020.', 'But if they continue obsessing about stock prices and quarterly earnings at the expense of a long-term vision, hiking defense spending and cutting welfare, blaming migrants and the poor, while allowing the rich to become richer and the environment to be further damaged, it will be another long year of living dangerously.', '', 'A Low, Dishonest Decade', 'MUMBAI ‚Äì I write this not as a professional economist, nor as a policymaker, but as a citizen of a tiny planet that is spinning through a vast universe that we barely understand.', 'I write this ‚ÄúAs the clever hopes expire / Of a low dishonest decade,‚Äù and as ‚ÄúWaves of anger and fear / Circulate over the bright / And darkened lands of the earth.‚Äù', 'It was 80 years ago that W.H.

appear.', 'It is during these periods that one must rethink the laws of the social sciences, the basis of our behavior, and the balance of our choices.', 'As human beings, we must do what Russell‚Äôs chicken could not: reject complacency and take stock of our own predicament.', 'Exactly ten years before Auden wrote his poem, the economist-statistician Harold Hotelling published a paper that became a seminal work for understanding electoral democracy.', 'It showed that political parties have a propensity to drift closer to each other, eventually creating a scenario in which there is little difference between the ‚Äúleft‚Äù and the ‚Äúright.‚Äù', 'This theory implied that over time all politicians will cater to the median voter.', 'The outcome could be criticized for being boring, not dangerous.', 'Hotelling‚Äôs work ‚Äì which was later picked up by economists Duncan Black and Anthony Downs ‚Äì established the paradigm for thinking about political economy in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.', 'But, owing to the disruptive advances of globalization and technology, the ground beneath our feet was always shifting.', 'Now that the fault lines have appeared, it is clearly time to take stock of our model of electoral democracy.', 'Today‚Äôs political parties, reflecting and reinforcing a world defined by animus, are fleeing to opposite poles, rather than

people will see the democratic process as a tool for protecting their own narrow interests.', 'The irony is that voters in many countries are now electing politicians who oppose not just economic globalization, but democracy itself.', 'It is time to go back to the drawing board.', 'Policymakers, scientists, and economists clearly have their hands full.', 'But all citizens of this planet have a role to play in averting an even darker decade.', 'To do so will require looking beyond immediate self-interest.', 'We need a moral framework that includes empathy for people who do not look like us,

happy about this American notion.', 'During the heyday of Irish terrorism in the UK, successive British governments went out of their way not to concede to the IRA the notion that a war was being waged.', '‚ÄúWar‚Äù would have meant acceptance of the terrorists as legitimate enemies, in a sense as equals in a bloody contest for which there are accepted rules of engagement.', 'This is neither a correct description nor a useful terminology for terrorist acts, which are more correctly described as criminal.', 'By calling them war ‚Äì and naming an opponent, usually al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden ‚Äì the United States government has justified domestic changes that, before the 9/11 attacks, would have been unacceptable in any free country.', 'Most of these changes were embodied in the so-called ‚ÄúUSA Patriot Act.‚Äù', 'Though some of the changes simply involved administrative regulations, the Patriot Act‚Äôs overall effect was to erode the great pillars of liberty, such as

and police persecution now burdens quite a few.', 'A climate of fear has made life hard for anyone who looks suspicious or acts suspiciously, notably for Muslims.', 'Such restrictions on freedom did not meet with much public opposition when they were adopted.', 'On the contrary, by and large it was the critics, not the supporters, of these measures who found themselves in trouble.', 'In Britain, where Prime Minister Tony Blair supported the US attitude entirely, the government introduced similar measures and even offered a new theory.', 'Blair was the first to argue that security is the first freedom.', 'In other words, liberty is not the right of individuals to define their own lives, but the right of the state to restrict individual freedom in the name of a security that only the state can define.', 'This is the beginning of a new authoritarianism.', 'The problem exists in all countries affected by the threat of terrorism, though in many it has not become quite as specific.', 'In most countries of continental Europe, ‚Äú9/11‚Äù has remained an American date.', 'There is even a debate ‚Äì and indeed some evidence ‚Äì concerning the question of whether involvement in the ‚Äúwar against terrorism‚Äù has actually increased the threat of terrorist acts.', 'Germans certainly use this argument to stay out of the action wherever possible.', 'This stance, however, has not prevented the spread of something for which a German word is used in other languages, too: Angst .', 'A diffuse anxiety is gaining ground.', 'People feel uneasy and worried, especially when traveling.', 'Any train accident or airplane crash is now at first suspected of being an act of terrorism.', 'Thus, 9/11 has meant, directly or indirectly, a great shock, both psychologically and to our political systems.', 'While terrorism is fought in the name of democracy, the fight has in fact led to a distinct weakening of democracy, owing to official legislation and popular angst.', 'One of the worrying features of the 9/11 attacks is that it is hard to see their purpose beyond the perpetrators‚Äô resentment of the West and its ways.', 'But the West‚Äôs key features, democracy and the rule of law, have taken a far more severe battering at the hands of their defenders than by their attackers.', 'Two steps, above all, are needed to restore confidence in liberty within the democracies affected by the legacy of 9/11.', 'First, we must make certain that the relevant legislation to meet the challenge of terrorism is strictly temporary.', 'Some of today‚Äôs restrictions on habeas corpus and civil liberties have sunset clauses restricting their validity; all such rules should be re-examined by parliaments regularly.', 'Second, and more importantly, our leaders must seek to calm, rather than exploit, public anxiety.', 'The terrorists with whom we are currently at ‚Äúwar‚Äù cannot win, because their dark vision will never gain broad popular legitimacy.', 'That is all the more reason for

of four planes, flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, hit the Pentagon with a third, and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission.', 'In a matter of hours, more than 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans, but also people from 115 other countries, had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them.', 'September 11, 2001, was a terrible tragedy by any measure, but it was not a historical turning point.', 'It did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed, or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace.', 'On the contrary, 9/11 has not been replicated.', 'Despite the attention devoted to the ‚ÄúGlobal War on Terrorism,‚Äù the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies,

economic house in order; China‚Äôs trajectory within and beyond its borders; and the ability of the world‚Äôs governments to cooperate on restoring economic growth, stemming the spread of nuclear weapons, and meeting energy and environmental challenges.', 'It is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world.', 'Terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best.', 'They can destroy but not create.', 'It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda.', 'Moreover, measures have been implemented to push back, successfully, against terrorists.', 'Intelligence assets have been redirected.', 'Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient.', 'International cooperation has increased markedly, in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area.', 'Military force has played a role as well.', 'Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power.', 'Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad.', 'Drones ‚Äì unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered ‚Äì have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists, including many of the most important leaders.', 'Weak governments can be made stronger; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable.', 'But progress is not to be confused with victory.', 'Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease.', 'There will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men, women, and children in pursuit of political goals.', 'Indeed, terrorists are advancing in some areas.', 'Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world‚Äôs other most dangerous terrorists.', 'A mixture of instability, government weakness, and ideology in countries such as Yemen, Libya, Somalia, and Nigeria are providing fertile territory for terrorists to organize, train, and mount operations ‚Äì much as they did in Afghanistan did a decade ago.', 'New groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones.', 'There is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism.', 'We have seen it in Great Britain and the US.', 'The Internet, one of the great inventions of the modern Western world, has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world.', 'The question raised in October 2003 by then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is no less relevant today: ‚ÄúAre we capturing, killing, or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training, and deploying against us?‚Äù', 'All things being equal, we probably are.', 'But even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives, money, and making open societies less so.', 'What is to be done?', 'Alas, there is no single or silver bullet.', 'The establishment of a Palestinian state will not be enough for those terrorists who want to see the elimination of the Jewish state, any more than reaching a compromise over Kashmir will satisfy those Pakistan-based terrorists with bigger agendas vis-√†-vis India.', 'Reducing unemployment is desirable, of course, but many terrorists do not come from poverty.', 'Helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse, but this is easier said than done.', 'Of course, we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so.', 'But what may be most important, particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities, is to end any acceptance of terrorism.', 'The Nigerian father who warned the US embassy in Lagos that he feared what his own son might do ‚Äì before that same young man attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a flight to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 ‚Äì is an example of just this.', 'Only when more parents, teachers, and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and law-enforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the

'WASHINGTON, DC ‚Äì The negotiations to create a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European Union and the United States are being widely welcomed.', 'British Prime Minister David Cameron has called the TTIP a ‚Äúonce-in-a-generation prize,‚Äù citing potential gains of ¬£80 billion ($125.5 billion) each for the EU and the US and ¬£85 billion for the rest of the world.', 'For a world weary of waiting for the World Trade Organization‚Äôs interminable Doha trade round to conclude, even a bilateral trade initiative may seem like a boon, especially when, as a recent Financial Times editorial pointed out, ‚Äúbilateral‚Äù covers half of the world‚Äôs economy.', 'But there is a serious downside: The deal could hurt developing-country exporters, unless the EU and the US make a concerted effort to protect these actors‚Äô interests.', 'The feature of the proposed pact that elicits the most excitement ‚Äì its focus on regulatory barriers like mandatory product standards ‚Äì should actually incite the greatest concern.', 'Given low tariffs in the EU and the US ‚Äì less than 5%, on average ‚Äì further preferential reductions will not seriously handicap outsiders.', 'But, when it comes to standards ‚Äì such as those governing safety, health, and the environment ‚Äì the market-access requirements are brutal and binary: either you meet the established standard or you do not sell.', 'As a result, third-country firms‚Äô options will depend on how TTIP standards are established: through harmonization (adoption of a common standard) or mutual recognition (acceptance of goods that meet one another‚Äôs established standards).', 'The first option would enable producers everywhere to take advantage of economies of scale.', 'But, in some cases, the harmonized standard could be more stringent than some countries‚Äô original standards.', 'Even though new standards would apply to suppliers from all exporting countries, compliance costs usually vary, meaning that those less equipped to meet higher standards could suffer.', 'In the late 1990‚Äôs, when the EU decided to harmonize standards for aflatoxins (a group of toxic compounds produced by certain molds), eight member states ‚Äì including Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain ‚Äì raised their national standards substantially, which is likely to have caused African exports of cereals, dried fruits, and nuts to Europe to decline by as much as $670 million.', 'With mutual recognition, the EU and the US would accept each other‚Äôs standards or conformity-assessment procedures, allowing firms to adhere to the less stringent requirements in each area.', 'If the policy were extended to third-country firms, it would have a powerful liberalizing impact.', 'For example, Malaysian television producers could choose to comply with, say, America‚Äôs easier-to-meet safety standards, then sell the same product in both markets, reaping the benefits of economies of scale while lowering compliance costs.', 'If, however, the TTIP excluded third-country firms from the mutual recognition policy, their competitiveness vis-√†-vis European and American companies would diminish substantially.', 'Indeed, our research shows that when mutual-recognition agreements include restrictive rules of origin, intra-regional trade increases ‚Äì at the expense of trade with other countries ‚Äì and that developing countries tend to suffer most.', 'In fact, excessively constraining rules of origin have proved problematic for some of the EU‚Äôs previous recognition agreements, such as those governing professional-services standards.', 'While a Brazilian orange admitted for sale in Portugal can be sold throughout the EU, a Brazilian engineer or accountant licensed in Portugal must fulfill separate licensing requirements to work elsewhere in the EU, hampering much-needed labor mobility by forcing non-European workers to endure costly and inefficient bureaucratic procedures.', 'Furthermore, when it comes to tariffs and standards, WTO rules are not created equal.', 'While they protect countries excluded from bilateral or regional tariff agreements, thereby ensuring that integrated markets do not receive additional advantages, few safeguards exist to shield third countries from the fallout of agreements on mandatory standards.', 'Even in the absence of international rules, the EU and the US could take two actions to ensure that the TTIP does not have adverse consequences for developing economies.', 'First, they could allow all countries to reap the benefits of a bilateral mutual-recognition deal by agreeing not to impose restrictive rules of origin.', 'Second, where they do consider harmonization, they could favor the less stringent of the original standards, unless there is credible evidence that it would not support the relevant regulatory objective.', 'This is akin to a WTO test for departures from established international standards.', 'If the EU and the US made these two commitments, the rest of the world could follow the TTIP negotiations with hope, rather than trepidation.', '', 'A Bad Deal for America‚Äôs Future', 'WASHINGTON, DC ‚Äì The painfully negotiated US budget legislation that President Barack Obama signed on August 2 combines an increase in America‚Äôs government debt ceiling with reductions in federal spending, thus averting the prospect of the first default in the 224-year history of the United States.', 'But the agreement has three major flaws.', 'Two of them offset each other, but the third threatens what America needs most in the coming years: economic growth.', 'The first flaw is that the spending reductions are badly timed: coming as they do when the US economy is weak, they risk triggering another recession.', 'The measure‚Äôs second shortcoming, however, is that the spending reductions that it mandates are modest.', 'While the legislation does too little to address America‚Äôs problem of chronic and rising budget deficits, the damage that it inflicts on the economy in the short term is likely to be limited.', 'The third and most damaging flaw, however, is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places.', 'Because the Democrats in Congress have an almost religious commitment to preserving, intact, America‚Äôs principal welfare programs for senior citizens, Social Security and Medicare, the legislation does not touch either of them.', 'These programs‚Äô costs will rise sharply as the 78-million-strong baby-boom generation ‚Äì those born between 1946 and 1964 ‚Äì retires and collects benefits, accounting for the largest increase in government spending and prospective deficits in the years ahead.', 'And, because the Republicans in Congress have an equally strong allergy to raising any taxes, any time, under any circumstances, the bill does not rely at all on tax increases ‚Äì not even for the wealthiest Americans ‚Äì for the deficit reduction that it provides.', 'All of the spending cuts come from the ‚Äúdiscretionary‚Äù part of the federal budget, which excludes Social Security, Medicare, the Medicaid program for the poor, and interest on the national debt.', 'That leaves only about one-third of total federal spending from which to cut, and much of that goes to the defense budget, which Republicans will attempt to protect in the future.', 'So the structure established by the August 2 law concentrates deficit reduction on the ‚Äúdiscretionary non-defense‚Äù part of the federal budget, which is only about 10% of it.', 'This is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the US will need in the years ahead.', 'Worse yet, discretionary non-defense spending includes programs that are indispensable for economic growth ‚Äì and economic growth is indispensable for America‚Äôs future prosperity and global standing.', 'Growth is, in the first place, the best way to reduce the country‚Äôs budget deficits.', 'The higher the growth rate, the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates; and higher revenues enable smaller deficits.', 'Moreover, economic growth is necessary to keep the promise ‚Äì enormously important to individual Americans ‚Äì that each generation will have the opportunity to become more prosperous than the preceding one, the popular term for which is ‚Äúthe American dream.‚Äù', 'Just as important for non-Americans, only robust economic growth can ensure that the US sustains its expansive role in the world, which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East.', \"As Thomas L. Friedman and I explain in our forthcoming book That Used To Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back, a crucial factor in America's economic success has been an ongoing public-private partnership, which dates back to the founding of the country, that is imperiled by the pattern of budget cuts established by the August 2 legislation.\", 'That partnership has five components: wider opportunities for education in order to produce a workforce with cutting-edge skills; investment in infrastructure ‚Äì roads, power plants, and ports ‚Äì that supports commerce; funds for research and development to expand the frontiers of knowledge in ways that generate new products; an immigration policy that attracts and retains talented people from beyond America‚Äôs borders; and business regulations strong enough to prevent disasters such as the near-meltdown of the financial system in 2008 but not so stringent as to stifle the risk-taking and innovation that produce growth.', 'The first three elements of the American formula for growth cost money, and that money is included in the ‚Äúdiscretionary non-defense‚Äù part of the federal budget now targeted by the debt-ceiling legislation.', 'Cutting these programs will lower American economic growth in the long term, with negative consequences both at home and abroad.', 'Reducing the deficit by cutting funds for education, infrastructure, and research and development is akin to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fingers.', 'Most of the weight will remain, and one‚Äôs life prospects will have worsened significantly.', 'Reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do, but the August 2 law does it in the wrong way.', 'Unless more deficit reduction, which is inevitable, comes from curbing entitlement benefits and increasing revenues, and less from programs vital for economic growth, the result will be a poorer, weaker US ‚Äì and a more uncertain, if not unstable, world.', '', 'A Balanced EU Constitution', \"EU Commission President Romano Prodi has proposed a scheme to strengthen the Union's executive.\", 'Britain, France, and Spain are working on an opposing plan that will consolidate EU executive powers among the biggest EU states.', \"What's the ordinary European to think?\", \"Europe's citizens scarcely grasp the issues at the heart of the European Constitutional Convention in Brussels.\", 'Mountains of detail obscure problems;

funds for one component of total debt can be supplemented by surplus funds originally aimed at financing other components.', 'Second, troubles in any single component of total debt will have an impact on all the other components.', 'After the subprime crisis erupted, mortgage and consumer debt was paid down by households either with their savings or by default.', 'The fall in US total debt, and the narrowing of the financing gap between total debt and domestic funds, led to a significant improvement in the US current-account deficit in 2008-2009, disproving US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke‚Äôs claim that the deficit was caused by a global ‚Äúsaving glut.‚Äù', 'Indeed, America‚Äôs current-account position strengthened despite the dollar‚Äôs appreciation in the face of safe-haven demand.', 'Unfortunately, as a result of the private-sector deleveraging and an increase in household savings, the US economy, driven by debt and consumption, slid into recession.', 'To offset the negative impact of private-sector deleveraging on growth, the US government has maintained expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.', 'Now, with household debt sustained on a knife-edge after feverish government intervention, the fiscal position has deteriorated dramatically and the current-account balance has worsened again.', 'Sustainability of public debt has replaced sustainability of private debt as the biggest threat to financial stability, and the focus of debate about the US current account has shifted from the sustainability of foreign debt to the impact of reducing the external deficit on growth and employment.', 'The dilemma facing US policymakers is how to stimulate growth while lowering the level of total debt.', 'The most important way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening US competitiveness.', 'But where will increased competitiveness come from?', 'Devaluation of the dollar could improve US competitiveness in the short run, but it is not a solution.', 'Because rapid fiscal deterioration now has investors worrying about capital losses on US government securities, devaluation would make foreigners more hesitant to finance America‚Äôs budget deficit.', 'If foreign financing is not forthcoming, yields on US government debt will rise and the US economy will fall back into recession.', 'In the long run, America‚Äôs growth pattern must undergo a structural shift from reliance on debt and consumption one based on Americans vaunted capacity for creativity and innovation.', 'Only then will America improve its competitiveness enough to allow the government to reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels while maintaining a respectable growth rate.', 'But neither improved competitiveness, nor reduction of total debt, can be achieved overnight.', 'In the short run, the US current-account deficit will remain, regardless of which country runs bilateral surpluses.', 'Thus, China‚Äôs continued reinvestment of its current-account surplus in US government securities is of utmost important for US growth and financial stability.', 'Given that America benefits mightily from China‚Äôs purchases of US government securities, it is difficult to understand why the US government and Congress have been complaining so much about the bilateral current-account deficit.', 'It is also difficult to grasp why China is so reluctant to reduce its bilateral surplus, given meager returns on its massive holdings of US government securities and a sustained risk of large capital losses in the future.', 'The good news is that, following President Hu Jintao‚Äôs recent visit to Washington, both America and China have been taking positive steps to resolve their differences over the bilateral current-account balance.', 'That augurs well for a more rational and constructive Sino-American dialogue on global imbalances, which would certainly benefit the global economy.', '', 'Abandoning

Bank ‚Äì an institution whose mission is to reduce poverty ‚Äì last month approved a new corporate strategy (ADB Long Term Strategic Framework 2008-2020) that is ominously silent on the importance of employment and social protection for the poor.', 'A handful of influential ADB bureaucrats with large salaries, secured pensions, comprehensive health insurance, subsidized housing, and education for their children, have apparently decided that financing subsidized housing, health, nutrition, and child protection programs is not a priority.', 'Nor do they consider land reform, employment services, or pensions for all Asians a priority.', 'Instead, these officials have decided to refocus ADB operations on three areas: inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration, with a heavy emphasis on private-sector development.', 'The ADB is abandoning crucial public support for social development.', 'The new strategy is a reversal of the policies of the late 1990‚Äôs, when the ADB changed its objective from ‚Äúeconomic growth‚Äù to ‚Äúpoverty reduction.‚Äù', 'The ADB‚Äôs earlier policies were based on broad-based growth, good governance, and social development.', 'Ten years later, only an empty corporate motto of ‚Äúan Asia and Pacific region free of poverty‚Äù is left.', 'Social protection, housing, employment, and labor are not on the ADB‚Äôs new agenda.', 'Health and agriculture will be considered only on a highly selective basis.', 'Only education remains as a future investment sector, given its impact on productivity, but the rest of the much-needed social sector interventions have been abandoned in favor of investment in infrastructure, the environment, regional integration, and finance.', 'No lesson was learned from the Asian financial crisis, which underscored the importance of social protection.', 'Pensions are mentioned only under financial-sector development: the ADB is to promote private-led insurance, despite evidence from the United Nations, International Labor Organization, World Bank and NGOs showing that private pensions do not reach the poor.', 'If the ADB were serious about poverty reduction, it would put a significant share of its investments in social development, particularly on non-contributory universal social security schemes that can reduce poverty by 35% to 50%.', 'Why is the ADB constricting its agenda?', 'Why does it want to deny governments‚Äô access to much-needed funds for social development?', 'The ADB argues that other agencies are responsible for social development.', 'But that argument is unjustified: while institutions such as the UN and NGOs may work on social development, they are under-funded compared to the ADB.', 'Besides, plenty of other public and private institutions undertake the infrastructure and finance projects that the ADB now wants to focus on.', 'So, what is the ADB‚Äôs added value, and whom does it serve?', 'Certainly the ADB‚Äôs new strategy will not serve the majority of Asians, 60% of whom still live in poor rural areas.', \"Indeed, Asia and the Pacific account for three-quarters of the world's stunted, underweight, and malnourished children.\", 'Maternal mortality rates remain dismal in several countries.', 'As food prices rise, so is hunger and poverty.', 'External and internal pressure at the ADB‚Äôs Annual Meeting this May forced the bank to respond to the current food crisis through temporary safety-net food security programs.', 'It also offered medium-term measures such as infrastructure and rural finance.', 'All of these are good, but they are insufficient.', 'Other measures are needed to reduce poverty in rural areas, such as land reform and rights, agricultural extension services, expanding access to health and non-contributory social pensions, just to mention some.', 'ADB‚Äôs major goal, however, seems to be to scale up private-sector support from 15% to 50% of total bank operations.', 'Several countries have expressed reservations about this.', 'It will include direct financing, credit enhancements, and guarantees ‚Äì a subsidy to a sector known for its risky non-performing operations at the ADB ‚Äì as well as business-friendly regulations and removal of market ‚Äúbarriers,‚Äù which include social and labor rights.', 'Such rights can be tolerated only as minimum social safeguards, which the ADB is trying to neuter through another ongoing review.', 'Unless the ADB‚Äôs member governments reverse its current policies, they, too, will be blamed for ignoring the urgent needs of the poor.', 'Poverty reduction requires both economic and social policies that reach people.', 'Growth on its own is not sufficient to guarantee poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific.', '', 'A Banking Union Baby Step', 'BRUSSELS ‚Äì At the beginning of the financial crisis, it was said that banks were, in Charles Goodhart‚Äôs crisp phrase, ‚Äúinternational in life, but national in death.‚Äù', 'At the time (2008-2009), large international banks had to be rescued by their home countries‚Äô governments when they ran into trouble.', 'But the problem now in Europe is the opposite: banks are ‚Äúnational in life, but European in death.‚Äù', 'In Spain, for example, local savings banks (cajas) financed an outsize real-estate boom.', 'As the boom turned to bust, the losses threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the Spanish state, and the problem became European, because it threatened the very survival of the euro.', 'The Spanish case is symptomatic of a larger problem.', 'National supervisors always tend to minimize problems at home.', 'Their instinct (and their bureaucratic interest) is to defend their countries‚Äô ‚Äúnational champion‚Äù bank(s) abroad.', 'But their resistance to recognizing problems at home runs even deeper.', 'Until recently, the Spanish authorities maintained that the problems in their country‚Äôs real-estate sector were temporary.', 'To acknowledge the truth would have meant admitting that for years they had overlooked the build-up of an unsustainable construction boom that now threatens to bankrupt the entire country.', 'In the case of Ireland, the situation was initially not much different.', 'When problems started to surface, the finance minister at the time initially claimed that the country would carry out ‚Äúthe cheapest bank rescue ever.‚Äù', 'Given national supervisors‚Äô predictable tendency not to recognize problems at home, it seemed natural that the cost of cleaning up insolvent banks should also be borne at the national level.', 'It thus seemed to make sense that even in the eurozone, banking supervision remained largely national.', 'The recently created European Banking Authority has only limited powers over national supervisors, whose daily work is guided mainly by national considerations.', 'But reality has shown that this approach is not tenable.', 'Problems might originate at the national level, but, owing to monetary union, they quickly threaten the stability of the entire eurozone banking system.', 'At their June summit, Europe‚Äôs leaders finally recognized the need to rectify this situation, transferring responsibility for banking supervision in the eurozone to the European Central Bank.', 'Given that financial integration is particularly strong within the monetary union, putting the ECB in charge was an obvious choice.', 'Moreover, the ECB already bears de facto responsibility for the stability of the eurozone‚Äôs banking system.', 'But, until now, it had to lend massive amounts to banks without being able to judge their soundness, because all of that information was in the hands of national authorities who guarded it jealously and typically denied problems until it was too late.', 'Putting the ECB in charge should also help to stop the creeping disintegration process, which is not publicly visible, but is very real nonetheless.', 'Just ask any of the large international banking groups headquartered in financially stressed eurozone countries.', 'Consider the case of a bank headquartered in Italy, but with an important subsidiary in Germany.', 'The German operations naturally generate a surplus of funds (given that savings in Germany far exceed investment on average).', 'The parent bank would like to use these funds to reinforce the group‚Äôs liquidity.', 'But the German supervisory authorities consider Italy at risk and thus oppose any transfer of funds there.', 'The supervisor of the home country (Italy) has the opposite interest.', 'It would like to see the ‚Äúinternal capital market‚Äù operate as much as possible.', 'Here, too, it makes sense to have the ECB in charge as a neutral arbiter with respect to these opposing interests.', 'But, while putting the ECB in charge of banking supervision solves one problem, it creates another: can national authorities still be held responsible for saving banks that they no longer supervise?', 'Economic (and political) logic requires that the eurozone will soon also need a common bank rescue fund.', 'Officially, this has not yet been acknowledged.', 'But that is often the way that European integration proceeds: an incomplete step in one area later requires further steps in related areas.', 'This incremental approach has worked well in the past; indeed, today‚Äôs European Union resulted from it.', 'But a financial crisis does not give policymakers the time that they once had to explain to voters why one step required another.', 'They will have to walk much more quickly to save the euro.', '', 'Abba Eban: The Voice of Israel', \"For almost two generations, Abba Eban was Israel's voice - its messenger to the high and mighty among the nations as well as to the Jewish people all over the world.\", \"Since he first appeared at the side of Dr. Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940's during the struggle for Jewish statehood and sovereignty, few people could articulate the Zionist and later the Israeli case with comparable eloquence and conviction.\", 'With his Churchillian prose and almost Shakespearean cadences, his mellifluous phrases and sonorous voice carried for decades a message of hope from a people that could have lost all hope and trust in humanity after the horrors of World War II.', \"As Ambassador to the United States and the UN, and later as Foreign Minister, he represented an Israel with which the world's liberal imagination could identify.\", 'Larger and more powerful nations were envious of so a powerful spokesman, and his speeches became textbook models for statesmen and diplomats in distant lands.', 'His books - which he found time to write despite the hectic demands of diplomacy - were a unique combination of enormous erudition and crystalline clarity.', 'His scholarly training and rhetorical gifts supplemented each other in a rare fashion.', 'Rarely has a small country been represented by a statesman of such world stature: only Thomas Masaryk and Jan Smuts come to mind to compare with him.', 'He was a true patriot, in the old-fashioned sense of the word: proud of his people, but never ethno-centric; a man of the world, but deeply embedded in Jewish cultural heritage; focused on the plights and tribulations of the Jewish people, but never losing the universal horizon of mankind.', 'In short, he was a modern Jew in the best sense of the word.', 'It was said of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol that he spoke seven languages, all of them in Yiddish.', 'Of Eban it could be said that he spoke ten languages, and all of them with an Oxford/Cambridge accent.', 'Yet what appealed to the outside world was not always an asset in the rough and tumble of Israeli politics.', \"Perhaps Eban was too urbane, too much of a scholar and gentleman to be able to make it - in Disraeli's phrase - to the top of the greasy pole.\", 'Together with Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan he had to leave government in 1974 in the wake of the Yom Kippur War.', 'He could hardly have been held responsible for the hubris which led to the avalanche of 1973, yet it nonetheless brought him down as well.', 'He never found his way back, and when confronted with the New Politics of primaries and populism, he became dispirited when he could not cope with this new style.', \"In the international arena, Eban's pen was his sword, and the spoken word his lance.\", 'He was less adept in political infighting in Israel.', 'He could be a fierce turf fighter, yet it is fair to say that he could have fought harder for his moderate and dovish views in the post-1967 government in which he served.', 'It is far from clear if he would have prevailed, given his lack of an independent political base, but his international prestige and standing might have given him a chance if he would have chosen to throw the gauntlet.', 'He never did.', \"Eban's silence in the last years was not only a product of his disenchantment with Israeli politics or his failing health.\", 'At a time when public debate in Israel is torn between pseudo-religious nationalist fanatics and anti-Zionists masquerading as post-modernists, the moral certitudes of Eban, for all their urbanity, may sound shallow.', 'But nation-building requires moral stamina, and Eban provided it to his people and the world in abundance.', 'Without having spoken to Eban in the last few years, I have no doubt that he would be extremely unhappy about the turn of events after the failure of Camp David and Taba in 2000-01, and the present course of Israeli policies would fill him with foreboding.', 'Yet in all probability he would have been even more deeply disappointed in the inability of the Palestinians to come to terms with the existence of the Jewish state.', 'As an Arabist by training, immersed in Arab and Muslim culture, he always hoped that the glorious Arab past could be rejuvenated, that an Arab and Muslim culture of tolerance could triumph over fanaticism and extremism.', 'This was the bedrock of his hope for reconciliation between Jew and Arab.', \"That this Arab renaissance - to use the phrase of the great Palestinian scholar George Antonius - did not take place may have been Eban's greatest disappointment.\", 'Despite the high-born image Eban projected, he was an extremely vulnerable person: what some occasionally discerned as traits of vanity may have had their origins in his humble origins.', \"While appearing to own the Queen's English, Eban was not to the manor born: he came from the extremely modest fringes of Anglo-Jewry.\", 'He was, in the true sense of the word, a self-made man, whose pluck, ambition, drive and inner belief in his destiny carried him to the pinnacle of his achievements.', 'His was the aristocracy of the spirit.',

shaped by vast and impersonal forces.', 'The actions and decisions of one man or woman, no matter how powerful, cannot determine the destiny of nations.', 'This may be true much or most of the time.', 'But there are moments when an individual leader‚Äôs choices can change the course of history.', 'That has certainly been true in Russia, and it may soon turn out to be true in Turkey as well.', 'In Russia, the very existence of the regime constructed by President Vladimir Putin can be traced to a single decision taken by a single man, Boris Yeltsin, for purely personal reasons.', 'As Yeltsin prepared to stand down as Russia‚Äôs first democratically elected president, he sought a successor who would protect his personal safety and wealth, and that of his family, in his dotage.', 'Putin, the gray ex-KGB man, seemed much better equipped to fill that role than more democratically inclined figures like, say, Sergei Stepashin, another of Yeltsin‚Äôs prime ministers, who had showed little enthusiasm for the First Chechen War in 1994.', 'Yeltsin‚Äôs choice may have fit his personal agenda, but it consigned Russia to a return to authoritarianism.', 'In a sense, then, Yeltsin was responsible both for opening Russia to a democratic future and for closing that chapter in the country‚Äôs history.', 'Turkey‚Äôs future, too, is now seemingly in the hands of one man: former President Abdullah G√ºl.', 'With Turkish voters headed to the polls on November 1 for the country‚Äôs second general election this year, G√ºl must decide whether to stand behind President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan.', 'His choice may determine whether Turkey remains on a democratic path or veers toward a future shaped by Erdoƒüan‚Äôs own brand of Putinism.', 'G√ºl has been placed in this critical position because, in the last election, held in June, Erdoƒüan‚Äôs ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) failed to win a governing majority, much less the constitutional majority that would enable Erdoƒüan to transform Turkey‚Äôs parliamentary system into a presidential one.', 'After the election, the AKP went through the motions of seeking to forge a coalition that could form a government ‚Äì an effort that many speculate Erdoƒüan sabotaged, so that he could call new elections.', 'Now that new elections have been called, Erdoƒüan is using nationalist appeals, and even the suggestion of actual war against a national minority, the Kurds, to propel his party to victory.', 'This rhetoric is reminiscent of Putin‚Äôs bellicose stance during the Second Chechen War in 1999, which boosted his popularity considerably, helping to make him a viable contender to succeed Yeltsin.', 'Erdoƒüan once claimed that democracy is ‚Äúlike a train,‚Äù in that ‚Äúwhen you reach your destination, you get off‚Äù ‚Äì a simile with which Putin would undoubtedly agree.', 'For both leaders, democratic systems are little more than blunt tools that can be used to advance one‚Äôs personal ambitions, and then discarded at will.', 'But there is one big difference between Putin and Erdoƒüan.', 'Once Yeltsin was out of the way, Putin was dependent on no other figure; he was master of the Kremlin, the ultimate arbiter of disputes among the rival figures and clans of the post-Soviet Russian elite.', 'Erdoƒüan, by contrast, had a partner in forming the AKP: G√ºl.', 'And G√ºl, unlike Yeltsin, has retained a powerful and loyal political following since leaving office.', 'When the AKP ‚Äì which advocated a moderate form of Islamist politics that challenged the secularism that had prevailed since modern Turkey‚Äôs founding ‚Äì won its first election in 2002, it was G√ºl who served as Prime Minister, because Erdoƒüan was banned from holding political office at the time.', 'The economic reforms and other liberalizing measures undertaken under G√ºl‚Äôs leadership led many people to believe that the AKP was creating a form of Islamist politics akin to that of European Christian Democracy.', 'But when Erdoƒüan took over as Prime Minister in 2003, G√ºl was effectively shunted into the shadows (Turkey‚Äôs presidency at the time was a largely ceremonial office).', 'And as Erdoƒüan, like Putin, concentrated power in his own hands, G√ºl‚Äôs social and economic achievements began to be dismantled.', 'No one speaks of the AKP anymore as a model for Muslim democrats to follow.', 'And, indeed, many senior AKP members who helped G√ºl‚Äôs government to succeed have left ‚Äì or been driven from ‚Äì the party.', 'In his book Profiles in Courage, John F. Kennedy wrote that, in politics, there comes a moment when ‚Äúa man must do what he must ‚Äì in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers, and pressures.‚Äù', 'For G√ºl, that moment is now.', 'G√ºl can remain silent and watch his former friend and political partner follow in Putin‚Äôs authoritarian footsteps, making a mockery of his own efforts to show the world that Islam can coexist with democracy, modernity, and tolerance.', 'Or he can speak out against Erdoƒüan‚Äôs plans, thereby helping to preserve his life‚Äôs work and, even more important, his country‚Äôs democratic system.', 'Such a profile in courage is precisely what Turkey needs today.', '', 'Abdullah Out On A Limb', 'Crown Prince Abdullah‚Äôs peace proposal was born in Saudi Arabia but some allege that it was conceived in the US. Revealed to a visiting American journalist during a private dinner with the Crown Prince, the plan centers on a ‚Äúfull normalization‚Äù of relations between Israel and all Arab countries, in return for an Israeli withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories it occupied in 1967. The proposal may get a boost when Abdullah meet President Bush in Texas later this spring, but its early survival depends first on its reception at the upcoming Arab summit in Beirut.', 'The suspicions which surround Abdullah‚Äôs peace initiative, and which dismiss it as stillborn, are founded in the belief that it was conceived to appease Saudi Arabia‚Äôs American critics and to divert them from focussing on Saudi domestic tensions. Since September 11th, Saudi Arabia has felt intense pressure to explain (and explain away) its links to Osama bin Laden‚Äôs al-Qaeda terrorist network because fifteen of the nineteen plane hijackers were Saudis (indeed, the majority of prisoners held by the US at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba are said to be Saudi citizens) and Saudis are often viewed as a major source of al-Qaeda‚Äôs finances. Moreover, it is alleged that the Saudi government has become preoccupied with appeasing America, despite the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada, and Israel‚Äôs ongoing occupation of Palestine.', 'At the same time, Saudi public opinion has been inflamed, mostly because of their rulers‚Äô apparent apathy toward the plight of the Palestinian people, particularly when contrasted with Osama bin Laden‚Äôs lethal propaganda. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11th, Saudi leaders have felt pressed to accommodate public revulsion about the mistreatment of the Palestinians, but worry that doing so may even further jeopardize their now brittle relations with America.', 'Crown Prince Abdullah‚Äôs initiative provoked widespread surprise, not because the idea is so startlingly new, but because of its source and timing. A proposal for ‚Äúfull normalization‚Äù with Israel coming from an Islamic regime that bases its legitimacy on the austere Islamic doctrines of the Wahhabi seems both peculiar and progressive. But Saudi Arabia‚Äôs long-cultivated image of stability, benevolence, and mystical communal harmony has given way under the endless glare of the American press. Its educational system, too, is increasingly portrayed as a breeding ground for hatred of the West. Something had to give.', 'America‚Äôs seemingly hostile attention gave rise to the speculation that Crown Prince Abdullah‚Äôs initiative really denotes a Saudi public relations counteroffensive, hatched in the Saudi embassy in Washington to cover over the rift with the US. Indeed, the subsequent, deafening silence by other Saudi leaders to the proposal appears to confirm it as a public relations move for which they need not risk any of their own domestic political capital.', 'Although Abdullah is usually referred to in the West as Saudi Arabia‚Äôs ruler, the debilitated King Fahd‚Äôs six full brothers are the ones who truly represent the real power in the Kingdom. Almost nothing, neither in support nor in opposition, has been uttered by the King and these other brothers, collectively known as the ‚ÄúSudairis.‚Äù', 'The Sudairis, it seems, have apparently left their half brother alone to twist in the wind. Abdullah‚Äôs proposal could weaken his position domestically, particularly in relation to the country‚Äôs powerful Islamists.', 'For although Crown Prince Abdullah has his own loyal entourage, including the National Guard, he confronts opposition from senior figures in the religious establishment.', 'The idea of normalizing relations with Israel has incited fierce hostility among some imams in the mosques as well as on the Internet.', 'As a result, Abdullah‚Äôs initial proposal has been diluted, so much so that, by the time of the Arab foreign ministers meeting held in Cairo on 8 March, the phrase ‚Äúfull normalisation‚Äù was watered down to the more amorphous phrase ‚Äúfull peace,‚Äù the meaning of which no one knows.', 'Does it mean an Israeli Star of David flag flying in Riyadh, or that Abdullah will visit Jerusalem to be greeted with a kiss from Ariel Sharon? No one knows, but the very fact that such questions are being raised in Saudi Arabia poses a serious risk to Abdullah.', 'Objections are also voiced against the fact that the Crown Prince‚Äôs plan does not mention the right of exiled Palestinians to return to their homes in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Israel proper, and that Arabs must tailor their diplomatic initiatives to the taste of the American media. To the average Saudi, the initiative appears as either a sell-out or the prelude to a fresh Arab humiliation. In either case, it is widely feared that either of these outcomes is intended simply to appease America.', 'Reactions in the Middle East reflect longstanding rivalries for leadership, as well as fears about American and Israeli intentions. Egypt‚Äôs leaders deem the proposal a mere conversation, something not nearly as serious as a written diplomatic initiative. Libya offered its own supposedly more ‚Äúencompassing and comprehensive‚Äù proposal.', 'Hizbollah‚Äôs leader Mohammed Fadlallah defined the initiative as one of Arab submission, while Syria demanded a guarantee of its interests in the Golan Heights.', 'Arab League officials approved the proposal.', 'Crown Prince Abdullah‚Äôs initiative is meant to be made official during a speech at the Arab League summit in Beirut of 27-28 March.', 'How it is received may not only determine the state of Israel-Palestine negotiations for a considerable time to come, but Saudi Arabia‚Äôs domestic peace as well.',

thousands of people worldwide of active control of their muscles, making them prisoners in their own bodies.', 'Research on ALS should be well funded, and the campaign appears to show the public‚Äôs readiness to fight for anything that might save lives.', 'Or does it?', 'The contrast between the Ice Bucket Challenge and this summer‚Äôs other major health story, the worst Ebola outbreak in recorded history, could not be more striking.', 'While thousands of Americans soak themselves to benefit ALS research, Ebola has become a public-health catastrophe in West Africa, one of the world‚Äôs poorest regions.', 'The virus kills up to 90% of its victims by interrupting the blood‚Äôs natural ability to clot, causing terrible bleeding and shutting down vital organs.', 'As with ALS, there is no tried and tested way to prevent or treat the disease.', 'In just a few weeks, Ebola has infected 3,707 men, women, and children, so far killing 1,848.', 'The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that the disease could infect 20,000 people before it is controlled.', 'Although far more than 20,000 people worldwide have ALS ‚Äì from which many will die ‚Äì the highly infectious Ebola virus is different, because it can wipe out entire communities.', 'Preventing Ebola‚Äôs spread involves painstaking tracking and quarantining of high-risk individuals.', 'But doing so is often impossible owing to lack of funds, manpower, and infrastructure, requiring the military to quarantine entire neighborhoods.', 'Moreover, the virus has claimed the lives of many doctors trying to treat victims, and forced the closure of hospitals that were unable to contain the virus.', 'The impact on struggling economies has been devastating.', 'For example, in Liberia‚Äôs capital, Monrovia, the price of Cassava, a dietary staple, has soared by 150%, along with price rises of other basic foods.', 'As a result, even after the epidemic has passed, survivors will continue to struggle.', 'This raises a simple question: Why have so many people ‚Äì first in the United States, and then around the world ‚Äì seemed so eager to support ALS research while ignoring a far more urgent public-health (if not humanitarian) crisis.', 'Part of the answer is that the Ice Bucket Challenge has given an esoteric disease a human face.', 'People increasingly identify with the fight against ALS through the entertaining video recordings of friends and relatives.', 'By contrast, the Western media has portrayed Ebola as yet another in a long list of tragic, African diseases that has little impact elsewhere.', 'But there is another, perhaps more disturbing, explanation.', 'Ebola‚Äôs main victims ‚Äì poor, black, African ‚Äì are part of a demographic that, to put it mildly, is of little interest to mainstream America.', 'Consider, for example, the different perspective on August‚Äôs protests in Ferguson, Missouri, which followed the police shooting of a young, unarmed black man.', 'Surveys reveal that 80% of African-Americans thought the issue had raised important questions about race in the United States; only 44% of whites agreed.', 'So it should not be surprising that the $110 million that the Ice Bucket Challenge has already raised for ALS is almost 50% more than the US government has committed to fighting Ebola, despite public-health leaders‚Äô pleas for funds.', 'Maybe the ALS Association, which sponsored the Ice Bucket Challenge, would consider allocating a proportion of its money to help the effort to end the Ebola epidemic.', 'Such a move would be unprecedented, but desperate times call for desperate measures.', 'ALS fundraisers may celebrate the fact that their campaign has ‚Äúgone viral.‚Äù', 'For Ebola sufferers, that very modern phrase carries a different, more traditional meaning.', 'As the ice-bucket craze spread across Facebook and Twitter, Ebola began ravaging swaths of West Africa village by village.', 'If these communities also had

'The official version on the Japanese government‚Äôs website has always featured three ‚Äúpolicy arrows‚Äù targeted at aggressive monetary policy, flexible fiscal policy, and growth strategy, including structural reform.', 'Of these, monetary policy was clearly the biggest focus.', 'The Bank of Japan (BOJ) launched a massive quantitative-easing (QE) program to buy up government debt, of which it now owns about half.', 'But while the official goal was to push up annual inflation to 2%, that target has yet to be reached.', 'The low efficacy of QE was predictable from the outset, given that long-term interest rates were already low in early 2013, at around 0.6%.', 'Since 2016, they have fluctuated around zero.', 'One might thus attribute to Abenomics‚Äô monetary ‚Äúarrow‚Äù a fall

the nominal GDP growth rate remains above 2% and the fiscal deficit is equal to or below 3% of GDP.', 'One key achievement of Abenomics, then, is that it stabilized Japan‚Äôs public finances.', \"Enjoy unlimited access to the ideas and opinions of the world's leading thinkers, including weekly long reads, book reviews, and interviews; The Year Ahead annual print magazine; the complete PS archive; and more ‚Äì All for less than $9 a month.\", 'The third arrow comprised structural reforms that would spur economic growth by boosting the productivity of the existing labor force and increasing the number of workers.', 'On the matter of productivity gains, Abenomics was a total failure.', 'Unlike in the eurozone, where labor productivity has at least inched up over the past seven years, Japan‚Äôs productivity has been essentially flat since 2010.', 'By contrast, there has been at least some progress on the size of the labor force.', 'But Japan had already achieved a high participation rate before Abenomics began, and the increases since then were in line with what one would have expected anyway.', 'With only small increases in labor force participation and almost no improvement in productivity, Japanese income growth under Abenomics has remained as low as it was before, averaging less than 1% per year.', 'For a short while, a strong rebound after tax hikes induced a recession in 2014 was seen as proof of Abenomics‚Äô success.', 'But the recovery was aided by a strong gain in the country‚Äôs terms of trade, owing to the falling price of liquid natural gas, which Japan needed to import in greater quantities following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.', 'This one-time boost was hardly enough to launch a new era of sustained stronger growth.', 'Japan‚Äôs experience should be studied carefully for lessons of what may lie in store for Europe and other aging advanced economies.', 'One key lesson from Japan‚Äôs experience is that it is exceedingly difficult to generate inflation in an aging society with excess savings and abundant capital.', 'In 2014, core inflation fell briefly below 1% in the eurozone.', 'The European Central Bank then started its own large asset-purchase program.', 'But after years of buying, inflation barely rose above 1%.', 'And now, the pandemic will have made it even harder to attain the canonical 2% inflation rate.', 'In fact, the ECB may well be pursuing an impossible target for the foreseeable future.', 'A second lesson is that headline growth rates matter politically, even if income per capita is what really counts when it comes to economic welfare.', 'This is key for Europe, because the demographic trends in the eurozone today are similar to those in Japan in the recent past.', 'The average working-age population across the eurozone‚Äôs 19 members is declining by about half a percentage point per year.', 'This decline is less pronounced than in Japan, but it is nonetheless set to continue for a long time, implying that the eurozone is heading for another decade of low headline growth, regardless of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.', 'And while per capita income growth remains possible, realizing it will depend on productivity increases.', 'Finally, in the absence of higher immigration, the limits imposed by a shrinking working-age population can be overcome by raising the retirement age and increasing the labor force participation of the elderly.', 'Such changes are in line with rising life expectancies more generally, and were already happening in many European countries prior to the COVID-19 crisis.', 'But increasing labor force participation can provide only a one-off benefit.', 'Robust growth over the long term will require higher productivity growth.', 'That is Europe‚Äôs main economic challenge.', 'To meet it head on, the vast fiscal resources being marshaled to deal with the pandemic must be used to shift the economy in a greener, more digital direction, rather than to prop up yesterday‚Äôs economic structures and arrangements.', '', 'The Renewed Promise of Abenomics', 'TOKYO ‚Äì Japan‚Äôs Liberal Democratic Party scored a decisive victory in the December 14 parliamentary election, with Japanese voters demonstrating their overwhelming approval of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe‚Äôs macroeconomic policy agenda.', 'Though voter turnout was relatively low, owing largely to the somewhat technical nature of the issues, the election‚Äôs message was clear: most Japanese abhor the prospect of a return to the grim economic trajectory that prevailed in Japan before ‚ÄúAbenomics.‚Äù', \"When the first ‚Äúarrow‚Äù of Abenomics ‚Äì a fiscal stimulus program ‚Äì was launched nearly two years ago, asset markets' immediate response was positive.\", 'The second arrow of Abenomics ‚Äì monetary easing ‚Äì intensified these effects.', 'In the last two years, Japan‚Äôs stock market has almost doubled in value, increasing the wealth of Japanese consumers.', 'Moreover, the yen has fallen by nearly one-third against the US dollar, from around ¬•80 to nearly ¬•120 per dollar, invigorating Japan‚Äôs export industries.', 'Even more encouraging are developments in the labor market, which, unlike those in asset markets, reflect outcomes, not expectations.', 'Here, too, the news is good.', 'The labor market has tightened, with unemployment standing at 3.5% and the job-to-applicant ratio above parity.', 'To be sure, there have been some setbacks: Japan‚Äôs GDP shrank in the second and third quarters of 2014.', 'But the downturn, which resulted from April‚Äôs consumption-tax hike ‚Äì from 5% to 8% ‚Äì cannot be blamed on Abenomics.', 'Indeed, Abe was honoring a law enacted by the previous government, led by the Democratic Party of Japan.', 'The first two arrows of Abenomics were aimed at stimulating demand ‚Äì and they were extremely effective.', 'The consumption-tax hike was needed to sustain them in flight.', 'Unfortunately, the hike was too large to keep them aloft.', 'The good news is that the tax hike‚Äôs impact is temporary.', 'Soon, it will begin to taper off, and industrial output will approach full capacity.', 'When demand begins to exceed supply, demand-side stimulus policies will become increasingly ineffective, and it will be time to launch the third arrow of Abenomics: growth-enhancing structural reforms.', 'Such reforms are essential to raise productivity growth and improve the Japanese economy‚Äôs competitiveness.', 'Four imperatives stand out.', 'The first task should be to eliminate ‚Äì or, at least, reduce ‚Äì the thicket of government regulations that is stifling economic dynamism.', 'The current system is so convoluted and complex that it took more than three decades to open a new medical school in Tokyo.', 'Likewise, flights to Haneda airport, a convenient connection to the Tokyo city area, have been rationed.', 'This is no formula for long-term economic success.', 'Furthermore, Japan‚Äôs government should push to complete negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is currently being negotiated among 12 countries, from Mexico to the United States to Vietnam.', 'The TPP would improve Japan‚Äôs trade prospects considerably, including in sensitive sectors like agriculture, where exports of fast-moving consumer goods like flowers and vegetables would benefit.', 'Japan‚Äôs leaders must also work to expand the workforce, which faces severe constraints, owing largely to the country‚Äôs rapidly aging population.', 'In the absence of large-scale immigration, to which Japanese remain unamenable, one relatively simple solution would be to integrate more women into the labor force.', 'A 10% increase in Japan‚Äôs female labor-force participation rate ‚Äì an entirely attainable goal ‚Äì would translate into an almost 5% gain in total labor-force participation.', 'Finally, Abe‚Äôs government must reduce the corporate-tax rate to align it more closely with international standards.', 'Amid increasingly intense international competition to attract foreign investment, reducing the corporate tax would actually increase Japan‚Äôs tax revenues, by spurring companies to invest their vast cash stockpiles in more productive activities.', 'Now that Abe‚Äôs government has a renewed mandate from Japanese voters, it must deliver on its promises ‚Äì and that means decisive and comprehensive implementation of structural reforms.', 'Of course, this will require some sacrifices.', 'Indeed, households have already endured some hardship, brought about by the consumption-tax hike.', 'The next step is for Abe‚Äôs government to use its political capital to overcome vested interests, both in the bureaucracy and the business community.', 'This means compelling businesses to give up some of the special tax benefits they now enjoy.', 'For their part, politicians must participate in the taxpayer identification system.', 'And bureaucrats must forego some of the power that excessive regulation affords them.', 'If all of these groups join the Japanese public in accepting reasonable sacrifices, Abe‚Äôs government can fulfill its promise and build a thriving economy.', 'For the sake of all Japanese ‚Äì not to mention a world economy in need of a new source of dynamism ‚Äì that promise deserves to be met.', '', 'The Missing Arrow of Abenomics', 'TOKYO ‚Äì In his drive to kick-start the Japanese economy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, shortly after taking office in 2012, introduced a large fiscal stimulus and put in place a bold program of monetary easing.', 'Since then, Japanese policymakers have been working to launch what Abe calls the third ‚Äúarrow‚Äù of his agenda: arduous reforms of key industries and the demolition of structural barriers to growth.', 'But the focus on public policy has left a ‚Äúfourth arrow‚Äù ‚Äì the private sector ‚Äì untouched and seemingly ignored.', 'This is unfortunate, because the government cannot fix Japan‚Äôs ills on its own.', 'Annual productivity growth has been stubbornly sluggish, rarely rising above 2% for much of the past two decades, reflecting both missed opportunities and declining cost competitiveness.', 'Japan‚Äôs productivity slump permeates the entire economy; labor and capital productivity gains have nearly stalled in almost every sector ‚Äì even in Japan‚Äôs signature advanced manufacturing industries.', 'Labor productivity in the transport-equipment sector, for example, is barely half that of Germany.', 'This trend puts annual GDP growth on course to average only 1.3% through 2025, implying a third consecutive decade of stagnation.', 'Such an outcome would coincide with ‚Äì and exacerbate the effects of ‚Äì an adverse demographic shift that will constrain fiscal revenues and drive up costs for universal health care and pension benefits.', 'Japan‚Äôs ability to alter its trajectory depends on individual companies making decisions to invest, change workplace policies, deploy new technologies, and test untried business models.', 'Abe‚Äôs structural reforms will take time and political will to enact, but Japanese companies cannot afford to sit still.', 'They can and must act, without waiting for the government to change its policies.', 'In many cases, the economy‚Äôs bottlenecks are not regulatory in nature, but stem from entrenched ways of doing business.', 'New research by the McKinsey Global Institute examines Japan‚Äôs advanced manufacturing, retail, financial services, and health-care industries in detail ‚Äì and finds substantial untapped productivity potential in every area.', 'For starters, Japanese firms must become more globally integrated.', 'Exporting to the fastest-growing overseas markets is one obvious route to overcoming sluggish demand growth at home.', 'But, rather than just selling products abroad, Japanese enterprises need to expand operations beyond their borders and cast a wider net for international talent.', 'Japanese companies have formidable R&D operations, but most will need to reconfigure them to obtain better returns and impact.', 'The process must start with an understanding of what the customer wants and a determination to deliver solutions accordingly.', 'Closed and tightly managed R&D operations must be transformed into more fluid, open processes involving collaboration with customers and suppliers.', 'Japanese companies will also need to improve their capabilities in areas such as marketing, pricing, and talent development.', 'While there are some pockets of excellence, most Japanese firms are severely lacking in these areas.', 'To compete in global markets, they will need to achieve the same consistency in these areas that they have in their traditional areas of strength.', 'Many Japanese companies have yet to digitize paper-based processes and replace outdated information-technology systems.', 'Others would benefit from moving beyond basic digitization to next-generation technologies, such as big-data analytics.', 'Companies can also head off looming labor shortages with intelligent software systems and robotics.', 'Manufacturers can augment or replace their assembly lines with technologies such as the Internet of Things and 3D printing.', 'More broadly, Japanese companies have to organize for performance and discipline.', 'As policy changes unleash market forces, businesses will face greater competition.', 'Some may need to reorganize or exit unprofitable markets; others may have to undertake mergers and acquisitions to achieve economies of scale.', 'Finally, shareholders and senior executives should tie performance goals to incentives.', 'Some of Japan‚Äôs corporate giants have already begun shifting from traditional seniority-based advancement toward merit-based pay structures.', 'Others should follow their lead.', 'Promoting younger and more diverse talent can create agile organizations with fresh ideas.', 'If Japan‚Äôs private sector rises to the challenge, it can move the economy onto a path of faster growth.', 'Innovations in one company would cascade across its entire industry by forcing competitors to raise their game.', 'In the 1950s and 1960s, for example, Toyota introduced more efficient production processes that were eventually adopted by the entire automobile industry.', 'Instead of settling for a future of 1.3% annual GDP growth, Japan could attain roughly 3% annual growth through 2025.', 'Doing so would require the growth rate of labor productivity to more than double, but this is an attainable goal.', 'More than half of this growth increment can be met by adopting best practices that companies around the world already use, while technology can close much of the remaining gap.', 'Japanese business leaders need to combine big thinking with a focused attention to detail.', 'They will need to create innovative products, penetrate new markets, and make bold investments in equipment, technology, and talent, while simultaneously scrutinizing every aspect of their operations for inefficiency and waste.', 'Traditional ways of doing business may have to be abandoned.', 'But there is ample scope to make progress and spur faster economic growth.', 'Immense trade flows, the rise of billions of new consumers in the emerging world, and technology breakthroughs are rapidly transforming the global economy.', 'Japan can shift its current trajectory by turning this wave of disruption into opportunity.', '', 'From Russia With Unrequited Love', 'NEW DELHI ‚Äì Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has assiduously courted Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting with him more than a dozen times in four years.', 'This month he hosted Putin in Tokyo and in his hometown of Nagato (famed for its onsen, or natural hot springs).', 'But Abe‚Äôs courtship has so far yielded little for Japan, and much for Russia.', 'Abe‚Äôs diplomatic overtures to Putin are integral to his broader strategy to position Japan as a counterweight to China, and to rebalance power in Asia, where Japan, Russia, China, and India form a strategic quadrangle.', 'Abe has already built a close relationship with India, and he sees improved relations with Russia ‚Äì with which Japan never formally made peace after World War II ‚Äì as the missing ingredient for a regional power equilibrium.', 'But Abe‚Äôs trust-building efforts with Russia are not aimed only at checking Chinese aggression.', 'He also wants Russia to return its southernmost Kuril Islands ‚Äì a resource-rich area known as the Northern Territories in Japan ‚Äì which the Soviet Union seized just after the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.', 'In exchange, Abe has offered economic aid, investments in Russia‚Äôs neglected Far East, and major energy deals.', 'Abe has, however, encountered several obstacles.', 'For starters, Japan is a participant in the US-led sanctions that were imposed on Russia after it annexed Crimea in March 2014.', 'These sanctions have pushed Russia closer to its traditional rival, China; and Putin has publicly identified the sanctions as a hindrance to concluding a peace treaty with Japan.', 'In response to Abe‚Äôs overtures, Putin has doggedly tried to drive a hard bargain.', 'Russia has bolstered its defenses on the four disputed islands, and, just prior to this month‚Äôs summit, he told the Japanese media that the current territorial arrangement suits Russian interests.', '‚ÄúWe think that we have no territorial problems,‚Äù he said.', '‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Japan that thinks that it has a territorial problem with Russia.‚Äù', 'The US-led sanctions regime and low oil prices have battered the Russian economy, which is expected to contract by 0.8% in 2016.', 'Thus, Putin is more reluctant than ever to offer territorial concessions, lest it tarnish his domestic image as a staunch defender of Russian national interests.', 'Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that Abe left the recent ‚Äúonsen summit‚Äù with dashed hopes of resolving the territorial dispute, while Putin returned home with 68 new commercial accords.', 'Many of the new agreements are symbolic, but some are substantive, including deals worth $2.5 billion and an agreement to set up a $1 billion bilateral-investment fund.', 'Under the latter agreement, Japan and Russia are supposed create a ‚Äúspecial framework‚Äù for joint economic activities on the disputed islands.', 'But the plan has already run into trouble.', 'Peter Shelakhaev, a senior Russian official who leads the government‚Äôs Far East Investment and Export Agency, has indicated that there are legal hurdles to establishing such a framework, and that Japanese firms doing business on the Kurils would have to pay taxes to Russia.', 'If Japan did that, however, it would effectively be recognizing Russia‚Äôs jurisdiction over the islands.', 'Abe has thus been denied the legacy that he sought, while Putin has succeeded in easing Russia‚Äôs international isolation.', 'Abe was the first G7 leader to hold a summit with Putin after Russia annexed Crimea, and now Russia has won Japan‚Äôs economic cooperation, too.', 'Japan is the only G7 country that has a territorial dispute with Russia, and it is clearly more eager to reach a deal than the Kremlin is.', 'But this has only strengthened Russia‚Äôs hand.', 'While Japan has softened its position, and signaled that it may accept only a partial return of the islands, Russia has grown only more intransigent.', 'After the recent summit, Abe revealed that Putin now seems to be reneging on a 1956 agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union, which stipulates that the smaller two of the four islands will be returned to Japan after a peace treaty is signed.', 'As it happens, this year marks the 60th anniversary of that joint declaration, which was widely viewed as a breakthrough at the time.', 'The Kremlin is now suggesting that its commitment to fulfilling the declaration was conditional on Japan not joining any security alliance against Russia.', 'And Putin has expressed concerns that the 1960 Japan-US Security Treaty would extend to the disputed islands if they were returned, thus allowing the US to establish a military presence there.', 'Japan is in no position to address Russia‚Äôs concerns.', 'It cannot opt out of the US-led sanctions regime; and it cannot exempt the disputed Kurils from its security treaty with the US, especially now that it has been urging the US to provide an explicit commitment to defend the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, over which China claims sovereignty.', 'Putin, for his part, appears smugly content with his negotiating position.', 'Not only did he arrive almost three hours late to the onsen summit, in keeping with his habit of leaving foreign leaders waiting; he also declined a Japanese government gift ‚Äì a male companion for his native Japanese Akita dog, which Japan gave him in 2012.', 'There is little hope now that Abe will see tangible returns on the political capital he has invested in cultivating Putin.', 'And Japan‚Äôs dilemma will only deepen.', 'US President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs desire to improve relations with Russia may give Abe leeway to continue wooing Putin; but if Russia gets the US in its corner, it won‚Äôt need Japan anymore.', '', 'Japan‚Äôs Good Fight', 'SYDNEY ‚Äì Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe‚Äôs recent visit to the United States was, from his perspective, hugely successful.', 'The first revision in 18 years of the bilateral defense guidelines was concluded, giving Japan‚Äôs Self-Defense Forces an expansive role in providing logistical support to the US.', 'And US President Barack Obama reaffirmed that the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands, over which China has attempted to stake its claim, are covered by the mutual-defense treaty.', 'Progress was made on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, which needs Japan‚Äôs buy-in to succeed.', 'And Abe became the first Japanese leader to address a joint session of Congress.', 'But, despite this impressive list of achievements, the most striking part of Abe‚Äôs trip came at the end.', 'Instead of heading home soon after the official part of his visit was over, Abe headed to California, including Silicon Valley, for four days.', 'According to official Japanese media reports, Abe visited California to gain inspiration and insights to take back to Tokyo.', 'But the California sojourn also sent a strong message: graceful decline is not Japan‚Äôs pre-determined path.', 'Under Abe‚Äôs leadership, the country will do what it takes to reinvent itself economically, just as the US has done so many times.', 'Given the potential of expectations to shape real-world developments, via their impact on strategic and political decisions, this strategy makes sense.', 'Abe knows that he must challenge today‚Äôs prevailing narrative that Asia‚Äôs economic future belongs to China.', 'If he fails, pressure will mount on the region‚Äôs governments to align themselves with China geopolitically, potentially even following its lead in choosing prosperity over freedom.', 'As of now, most East Asian countries seem to hope that Abe succeeds.', 'Indeed, they have cautiously backed Japan as an essential counterweight to a rising China ‚Äì and with good reason.', 'Whereas China‚Äôs regional economic importance tends to be overestimated, Japan is often underrated.', 'In reality, Chinese trade within Asia ‚Äì for example, with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ‚Äì is carried out largely by firms with parent companies from advanced economies, including Japan.', 'Moreover, despite China‚Äôs reputation as the more dynamic growth market, Japanese consumers still have far deeper pockets than their Chinese counterparts, meaning that Japan plays a greater role in sustaining the region‚Äôs export-dependent economies.', 'Asia‚Äôs developing economies, including China, cannot reach their potential without foreign capital and innovation ‚Äì something that advanced economies like Japan provide.', 'Indeed, Japan provides far more foreign direct investment than China in every major economy in Southeast Asia and ASEAN as a whole, and its leading firms ‚Äì global players such as Mitsubishi and Sony ‚Äì transfer far more technology and know-how to developing Asia than their Chinese counterparts.', 'To be sure, China is working hard to catch up, with the government having identified entrepreneurship and innovation as essential to the evolution of the country‚Äôs growth model.', 'But when it comes to advanced technologies in emerging sectors like next-generation computing and energy systems, as well as developments in manufacturing like robotics and 3D printing, Japan‚Äôs considerable lead should not be underestimated.', 'Still, Japan will have to work hard to avoid losing its advantage.', 'That will mean undertaking difficult structural reforms, such as the liberalization of industrial relations.', 'Fortunately, Abe recognizes this imperative, and the third ‚Äúarrow‚Äù of his strategy to reinvigorate Japan‚Äôs economy has established it as an official goal, (together with opening up protected sectors ‚Äì particularly agriculture ‚Äì to greater external competition).', 'Of course, there is no guarantee that the structural-reform phase of ‚ÄúAbenomics‚Äù will succeed.', 'What is certain is that China faces an even more daunting challenge: it must reinvent, not just reform, its political economy.', 'Despite achieving three decades of rapid economic growth, China still functions on Cold War-era institutional hardware.', 'The kind of large-scale innovation occurring in advanced economies requires institutions that ensure the rule of law, intellectual property rights, and a genuine meritocracy, with the most deserving firms, not those favored by the state, having access to the funding and opportunities they need to grow.', 'In this respect, China still has a long way to go.', 'Japan was never out of the contest to shape Asia‚Äôs future economic order.', '(As one-half of the alliance that will play the largest role in defining the East Asian balance of power in the coming decades, Japan will also play a vital strategic role.)', 'But Abe‚Äôs recent trip to the US served as an important reminder of Japan‚Äôs centrality to Asian affairs.', 'It is somewhat ironic that, as the world gears up to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Japan‚Äôs defeat in World War II, the governments of the US and almost every major Asian country are quietly cheering for Abe.', 'What Japan is fighting for this time promises to bring far-reaching benefits, in Asia and beyond.', '', 'A Berlin Consensus?', 'HONG KONG ‚Äì A recent trip to Berlin brought back memories of an earlier visit in the summer of 1967, when I was a poor student who marveled at the Wall that would divide and devastate an entire society for another two decades.', \"Berlin today is vibrant and rejuvenated, rebuilt by the German peoples' hard work and sacrifice to unify the country, and an apt setting for the conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), which I was there to attend.\", 'The conference‚Äôs theme was ‚ÄúParadigm Lost,‚Äù with more than 300 economists, political scientists, systems analysts, and ecologists gathering to rethink economic and political theory for the challenges and uncertainty posed by growing inequality, rising unemployment, global financial disarray, and climate change.', 'Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was broken, but there was no agreement on what can replace it.', 'Nobel laureate Amartya Sen attributed the European crisis to four failures ‚Äì political, economic, social, and intellectual.', 'The global financial crisis, which began in 2007 as a crisis of US subprime lending and has broadened into a European sovereign-debt (and banking) crisis, has raised questions that we cannot answer, owing to over-specialization and fragmentation of knowledge.', 'And yet there is no denying that the world has become too intricate for any simple, overarching theory to explain complex economic, technological, demographic, and environmental shifts.', 'In particular, the rise of emerging markets has challenged traditional Western deductive and inductive logic.', 'Deductive inference enables us to predict effects if we know the principles (the rule) and the cause.', 'By inductive reasoning, if we know the cause and effects, we can infer the principles.', 'Eastern thinking, by contrast, has been abductive, moving from pragmatism to guessing the next steps.', 'Abductive inference is pragmatic, looking only at outcomes, guessing at the rule, and identifying the cause.', 'Like history, social-scientific theory is written by the victors and shaped by the context and challenges of its time.', 'Free-market thinking evolved from Anglo-Saxon theorists (many from Scotland), who migrated and colonized territories, allowing fortunate individuals to assume that there were no limits to consumption.', 'European continental thinking, responding to urbanization and the need for social order, emphasized institutional analysis of political economy.', 'Thus, the emergence of neoclassical economics in the nineteenth century was very much influenced by Newtonian and Cartesian physics, moving from qualitative analysis to quantifying human behavior by assuming rational behavior and excluding uncertainty.', 'This ‚Äúpredetermined equilibrium‚Äù thinking ‚Äì reflected in the view that markets always self-correct ‚Äì led to policy paralysis until the Great Depression, when John Maynard Keynes‚Äôs argument for government intervention to address unemployment and output gaps gained traction.', 'By the 1970‚Äôs, the neoclassical general-equilibrium school captured Keynesian economics through real-sector models that assumed that ‚Äúfinance is a veil,‚Äù thereby becoming blind to financial markets‚Äô destabilizing effects.', 'Economists like Hyman Minsky, who tried to correct this, were largely ignored as Milton Friedman and others led the profession‚Äôs push for free markets and minimal government intervention.', 'But then technology, demographics, and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the neoclassical approach could not foresee.', 'Even as the world‚Äôs advanced countries over-consumed through leveraging from derivative finance, four billion of the world‚Äôs seven billion people began moving to middle-income status, making huge demands on global resources and raising the issue of ecological sustainability.', 'New thinking is required to manage these massive and systemic changes, as well as the integration of giants like China and India into the modern world.', 'A change of mindset is needed not just in the West, but also in the East.', 'In 1987, the historian Ray Huang explained it for China:', '‚ÄúAs the world enters the modern era, most countries under internal and external pressure need to reconstruct themselves by substituting the mode of governance rooted in agrarian experience with a new set of rules based on commerce.‚Ä¶This is easier said than done.', 'The renewal process could affect the top and bottom layers, and inevitably it is necessary to recondition the institutional links between them.', 'Comprehensive destruction is often the order; and it may take decades to bring the work to completion.‚Äù', 'Using this macro-historical framework, we can see Japanese deflation, European debt, and even the Arab Spring as phases of systemic changes within complex structures that are interacting with one another in a new, multipolar global system.', 'We are witnessing simultaneous global convergence (the narrowing of income, wealth, and knowledge gaps between countries) and local divergence (widening income, wealth, and knowledge gaps within countries).', 'Adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evolve.', 'As the philosopher Bertrand Russell presciently put it: ‚ÄúSecurity and justice require centralized governmental control, which must extend to the creation of a world government if it is to be effective.', 'Progress, on the contrary, requires the utmost scope for personal initiative that is compatible with social order.‚Äù', 'A new wave of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called ‚Äúcreative destruction‚Äù is under way: even as central banks struggle to maintain stability by flooding markets with liquidity, credit to business and households is shrinking.', 'We live in an age of simultaneous fear of inflation and deflation; of unprecedented prosperity amid growing inequality; and of technological advancement and resource depletion.', 'Meanwhile, existing political systems promise good jobs, sound governance, a sustainable environment, and social harmony without sacrifice ‚Äì a paradise of self-interested free riders that can be sustained only by sacrificing the natural environment and the welfare of future generations.', 'We cannot postpone the pain of adjustment forever by printing money.', 'Sustainability can

included, NATO's enlargement to take in, among others, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- which were once Soviet republics -- is an impossible dream come true.\", 'When the idea was first floated some 10 years ago, expansion into the Baltics was taken seriously by few people.', 'Until recently, Russia\\'s robust opposition to the idea posed a serious obstacle, because it sharpened the impression that Russia regarded its so-called \"near abroad\" as a zone of special interest and influence.', 'NATO\\'s enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another country\\'s \"zone.\"', \"It assures the three small Baltic countries that the nightmare of occupation by big neighbors (Hitler's Reich and Stalin's USSR), which they endured for half-a-century -- will not be repeated.\", 'By putting paid to any revanchist tendencies in Russia concerning the Baltics, Europe is made a safer place, and Russia is helped in its effort to redefine itself as a national state and not an empire.', \"Expansion will also create a better Europe because enlargement widens the territory in which countries are committed to NATO's political values, including individual rights as well as the rights of minorities.\", 'Fortunately Russia now seems to grasp the value of this political aspect of NATO-enlargement.', 'Rightly so: enlargement of NATO is not an \"expansion\" that threatens Russia or other countries which strive for democratic political reforms.', 'On the contrary, expansion takes away the worries - be they real or imagined - that surround the situation of the large Russian-speaking populations that now live outside of Russia but within the borders of the former Soviet Union.', 'The civil rights of the Russian minorities in the Baltics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law, due in no small part to NATO demands.', 'Those civil rights initiatives on the part of NATO reflect the increasingly workmanlike way that Russia, Europe, and America now work out their disagreements.', 'Indeed, enlargement of NATO comes only a few days after a deal was struck between Russia and the EU on the tricky question of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.', 'This small piece of Russia, with 1 million inhabitants and bordering on the Baltic Sea, is squeezed between Poland and Lithuania, two future members of the EU.', 'This could have incited a complicated situation where Russians were faced with tough visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia proper.', 'A deal was struck between President Putin and the EU that makes access much easier without compromising the status of Lithuania and Poland within the EU-regime.', 'This, in turn, created once again the kind of win-win situation that is so important for future relations between the EU and Russia.', 'When the enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month, the conclusion is clear: Europe has become a much better and safer place to live in, thanks to the decisions taken by NATO and the EU during the crucial autumn of 2002.', 'But this is no cause for complacency.', 'For the really hard work is only now beginning: dealing with all the internal practical and political problems that these enlargements will bring, as well as reckoning with countries in the membership waiting rooms, in particular Russia.', 'Relations with Russia are of vital importance if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety.', 'The common threat of international terrorism must be faced jointly.', 'We need to convince each other that the fight against this common enemy has to be fought with a keen eye to balancing the needs of security with those of human and minority rights.', 'Kaliningrad could be a litmus test of these relations.', 'The first hurdle has been overcome with the agreement on access to the enclave.', \"The next hurdle is to support Kalingrad's fight against disease and crime as well as strengthening its economic and social structures.\", 'This calls for generosity from the EU and flexibility from Moscow.', 'In a wider context this could lead to a strengthening of the so-called Northern Dimension of the EU, where the goal is a free trade area to

twentieth century.', 'We must gain from the lessons of history the wisdom to guide our future.', 'More than one hundred years ago, vast colonies, possessed mainly by the Western powers, stretched across the world.', 'With their overwhelming supremacy in technology, waves of Western colonial forces surged toward Asia in the nineteenth century.', 'There is no doubt that the resulting sense of crisis drove Japan to pursue modernization.', 'Japan established a constitutional government earlier than any other country in Asia, and preserved its independence throughout.', 'The Japan-Russia War gave encouragement to many people under colonial rule from Asia to Africa.', 'After World War I, the movement for self-determination gained momentum and put brakes on colonization.', 'It was a horrible war that claimed as many as ten million lives.', 'With a strong desire for peace stirred in them, people founded the League of Nations and brought forth the General Treaty for the Renunciation of War.', 'There emerged in the international community a new movement that sought to outlaw war itself.', 'At the beginning, Japan, too, kept in step with other countries.', 'But with the Great Depression setting in and Western countries launching economic blocs involving their colonial possessions, Japan‚Äôs economy suffered a major blow.', 'In such circumstances, Japan‚Äôs sense of isolation deepened.', 'It attempted to overcome its diplomatic and economic deadlock through the use of force.', 'But Japan‚Äôs domestic political system could not serve as a brake to stop such attempts.', 'In this way, Japan lost sight of the overall trends shaping the world.', 'With the Manchurian Incident, followed by withdrawal from the League of Nations, Japan gradually transformed itself into a challenger to the new global order that the international community sought to establish after such tremendous sacrifices.', 'Japan took the wrong course and advanced along the road to war.', 'And, 70 years ago, Japan was defeated.', 'On the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, I bow my head deeply before the souls of all those who perished both at home and abroad.', 'I express my feelings of profound grief and my eternal, sincere condolences.', 'More than three million of our compatriots lost their lives during the war: on the battlefields worrying about the future of their homeland and wishing for the happiness of their families; in remote foreign countries after the war; in extreme cold or heat, suffering from starvation and disease.', 'The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the air raids on Tokyo and other cities, and the ground battles in Okinawa, among others, took a heavy toll among ordinary citizens without mercy.', 'In countries that fought against Japan, countless lives were lost among young people with promising futures.', 'In the battlefields of China, Southeast Asia, the Pacific islands, and elsewhere, numerous innocent citizens suffered and fell victim to fighting and hardships such as severe deprivation of food.', 'We must never forget that there were women behind the battlefields whose honor and dignity were severely injured.', 'Upon innocent people our country inflicted immeasurable damage and suffering.', 'History is harsh.', 'What is done cannot be undone.', 'Each and every one of them had his or her life, dream, and beloved family.', 'When I squarely contemplate this obvious fact, even now, I find myself speechless and my heart is rent with the utmost grief.', 'The peace we enjoy today exists only upon such precious sacrifices.', 'And therein lies the origin of postwar Japan.', 'We must never again repeat the devastation of war.', 'Incident, aggression, war ‚Äì we shall never again resort to any form of the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.', 'We shall abandon colonial rule forever and respect the right of self-determination of all peoples throughout the world.', 'With deep repentance for the war, Japan made that pledge.', 'Upon it, we have created a free and democratic country, abided by the rule of law, and consistently upheld our vow never to wage a war again.', 'While taking silent pride in the path we have walked as a peace-loving nation for as long as 70 years, we remain determined never to deviate from this steadfast course.', 'Japan has repeatedly expressed the feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology for its actions during the war.', 'In order to manifest such feelings through concrete actions, we have engraved in our hearts the histories of suffering of the people in Asia as our neighbors: those in Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines, and in Taiwan, the Republic of Korea, and China, among others; and we have consistently devoted ourselves to regional peace and prosperity since the end of the war.', 'This position, articulated by previous Japanese cabinets, will remain unshakable into the future.', 'However, no matter what kind of efforts we may make, the sorrows of those who lost their family members, and the painful memories of those who experienced immense suffering caused by the destruction of war, will never be healed.', 'Thus, we must take to heart the following:', '¬∑ More than six million Japanese repatriates managed to come home safely after the war from various parts of the Asia-Pacific region and became the driving force behind Japan‚Äôs postwar reconstruction.', '¬∑ Nearly 3,000 Japanese children left behind in China were able to grow up there and set foot on the soil of their homeland again.', '¬∑ Former POWs of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia, and other countries have visited Japan for many years to continue praying for the souls of the war dead on both sides.', 'How much emotional struggle and effort must have must have been necessary for the Chinese people, who underwent all the sufferings of the war, and for the former POWs, who experienced unbearable torment caused by the Japanese military, to be so tolerant?', 'That is what we must reflect upon.', 'Thanks to such manifestations of tolerance, Japan was able to return to the international community in the postwar era.', 'Taking this opportunity of the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, Japan would like to express its heartfelt gratitude to all the nations and all the people who made every effort for reconciliation.', 'In Japan, the postwar generations now exceed 80% of the country‚Äôs population.', 'We must not let our children, grandchildren, and even further generations to come, who have nothing to do with that war, be predestined to apologize.', 'And yet we Japanese, across generations, must squarely face the history of the past.', 'We have the responsibility to inherit the past, in all humbleness, and pass it on to the future.', 'Our parents‚Äô and grandparents‚Äô generations were able to survive in a devastated land in sheer poverty after the war.', 'The future they brought about is the one our current generation inherited and the one we will hand down to the next generation.', 'Together with the tireless efforts of our predecessors, this has been possible only through the goodwill and assistance extended to us that by a truly large number of countries, such as the United States, Australia, and European nations, which Japan had fiercely fought as enemies.', 'We must pass this down from generation to generation into the future.', 'We have the great responsibility to take the lessons of history deeply into our hearts, to carve out a better future, and to make all possible efforts for the peace and prosperity of Asia and the world.', 'We will engrave in our hearts the past, when Japan attempted to break the deadlock it faced with force.', 'Upon this reflection, Japan will continue to uphold firmly the principle that any disputes must be settled peacefully and diplomatically, based on respect for the rule of law, and to reach out to other countries in the world to do the same.', 'As the only country to have ever suffered the devastation of atomic bombings during war, Japan will fulfill its responsibility within the international community, aiming at the non-proliferation and ultimate abolition of nuclear weapons.', 'We will engrave in our hearts the past, when the dignity and honor of many women were severely injured during wars in the twentieth century.', 'Upon this reflection, Japan wishes to be a country always at the side of such women‚Äôs injured hearts.', 'Japan will lead the world in making the twenty-first century an era in which women‚Äôs human rights are not infringed.', 'We will engrave in our hearts the past, when forming economic blocs sowed the seeds of conflict.', 'Upon this reflection, Japan will continue to develop a free, fair, and open international economic system that will not be influenced by any country‚Äôs the arbitrary intentions.', 'We will strengthen assistance for developing countries, and lead the world toward further prosperity.', 'Prosperity is the very foundation of peace.', 'Japan will make even greater efforts to fight against poverty, which also serves as a hotbed of violence, and to provide opportunities for medical services, education, and self-reliance to all the people in the world.', 'We will engrave in our hearts the past, when Japan ended up becoming a challenger to the international order.', 'Upon this reflection, Japan will firmly uphold basic values such as freedom, democracy, and human rights as unyielding values, and, by working hand in hand with countries that share such values, hoist the flag of ‚ÄúProactive Contribution to Peace,‚Äù and contribute to the peace and prosperity of the world more than ever before.', 'Heading toward the 80th, 90th, and centennial anniversaries of the end of the war, the Japanese people are determined to create such a Japan.', '', 'Accepting Japan at Its Word', 'TOKYO ‚Äì In recent years, the number of tourists visiting Japan has been increasing rapidly, reaching a record 13.4 million last year, a 29% increase from 2013.', 'Japan seems to be making great strides toward its goal of recapturing the position as an Asian cultural center that it held a century ago, when the Indian Nobel laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore lived in Tokyo.', 'Chinese revolutionary leaders Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek, along with many other prominent Asians, moved there as well.', 'Anyone visiting Japan today would do well to learn two key words: domo, meaning ‚Äúhello,‚Äù ‚Äúthanks,‚Äù or ‚Äúwell,‚Äù and sumimasen, which can carry any of the meanings of domo, as well as ‚Äúsorry‚Äù or ‚Äúexcuse me.‚Äù', 'Ordinary Japanese say sumimasen countless times each day, to apologize to friends or strangers for even the most trivial accident or mistake.', 'But, as Japan‚Äôs leaders have experienced firsthand since World War II, expressing regret to other countries is not so simple.', 'Yet that is precisely what Prime Minister Shinzo Abe must do in his upcoming statement marking the 70th anniversary of the end of the war.', 'The statement will be based on consultations with many of Japan‚Äôs, and the world‚Äôs, leading WWII historians, as well as ‚Äì and more important ‚Äì with himself, his conscience, and his heart, because he understands the significance of his words on this highly fraught topic.', 'Of course, Abe is far from the first Japanese leader to confront this challenge.', 'His statement will follow a long line of declarations by prime ministers and chief cabinet secretaries expressing sincere remorse over the events of WWII.', 'Twenty years ago, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, the head of the Socialist Party, acknowledged that ‚ÄúJapan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries,‚Äù particularly in Asia.', 'He went on to express ‚Äúfeelings of deep remorse‚Äù and offer a ‚Äúheartfelt apology‚Äù to the victims.', 'Ten years later, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi reiterated Murayama‚Äôs words, adding that since the war, Japan had been ‚Äúmanifesting its remorse for the war through actions,‚Äù especially development assistance and humanitarian activities.', 'Koizumi also pledged that ‚ÄúJapan, as a peace-loving nation, will work to achieve peace and prosperity for all humankind with all its resources.‚Äù', 'Despite these straightforward declarations of regret, some governments and citizens continue to demand more, giving the impression that nothing a Japanese leader says or does will convince them of the country‚Äôs remorse.', 'This intractability is, in some cases, understandable; the pain of survivors and their descendants remains acute.', 'But in many other cases, the unwillingness to move beyond history is driven by political interests.', 'Indeed, political motivations are behind claims that Abe does not agree with past official apologies, despite his repeated assurances that he does, as well as suggestions that he is seeking to revise history, even though he has never denied Japan‚Äôs colonial aggression.', 'Moreover, some have produced portrayals of Japan, as a whole, as an unrepentant country ‚Äì or, worse, as one that is hell-bent on remilitarization.', 'Such depictions are breathtaking in their audacity, given Japan‚Äôs seven-decade record as a peaceful and constructive member of the international community.', 'This is not lost on those in Japan who ask for how long their country will have to apologize, with some even suggesting that after 70 years, a ‚Äútweet‚Äù on the subject should amount to adequate acknowledgement by Abe.', 'The prime minister, however, remains committed to issuing a strong and sincere statement on the subject.', 'Early this year, Abe announced his intention to use the 70th anniversary statement to communicate Japan‚Äôs remorse for the war, describe the progress the country has made in upholding peace, and describe the contributions that Japan can make to Asia and the rest of the world in the coming decades.', 'In fact, it is the third component of the announcement that inspires fear in some observers: By helping to build a strong security architecture in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan could undermine the ability of some actors to advance their own interests.', 'That is why they launched a whisper campaign against Abe‚Äôs statement months before he even began to write it.', 'But, of course, Asian security and prosperity is in everyone‚Äôs interest.', 'Given this, not even the language of Abe‚Äôs statement is particularly important; what matters is the determination he expresses, and the actions he takes to follow through ‚Äì with appropriate humility ‚Äì on his pledges.', 'And it seems that Abe is, indeed, determined to make real contributions to peace, based on effective cooperation with Japan‚Äôs friends and allies.', 'But if Asia is to move beyond its past, the victims of Japan‚Äôs wartime aggression must recognize that the Japan of 2015 is not the Japan of 1931, 1941, or even 1945, and that, as many Asian leaders have realized over the years, forgiveness benefits everyone.', 'In 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung responded positively to a statement by former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.', 'The governments of Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and other countries have done the same, and now welcome Japan‚Äôs commitment to act with its allies to protect regional security.', 'These countries‚Äô openness to reconciliation have enabled Japan to recast itself as a key arbiter of regional peace and prosperity, not to mention an increasingly dynamic cultural hub.', 'It is time for the rest of the region to follow suit, accepting at face value Japan‚Äôs sincere apologies and working with the country to build a better future.', 'At a time when Asia is facing serious security challenges, this stance could not be more urgent.', '', 'A Big Chance for Small Farmers', 'NEW YORK ‚Äì The G-8‚Äôs $20 billion initiative on smallholder agriculture, launched at the group‚Äôs recent summit in L‚ÄôAquila, Italy, is a potentially historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty.', 'With serious management of the new funds, food production in Africa will soar.', 'Indeed, the new initiative, combined with others in health, education, and infrastructure, could be the greatest step so far toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty, disease, and hunger by half by 2015 .', 'During 2002-2006, I led the United Nations Millennium Project, which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, for then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.', 'One cornerstone of the project was ‚Äúsmallholder farmers,‚Äù meaning peasant farm families in Africa, Latin America, and Asia ‚Äì working farms of around one hectare (2.5 acres) or less.', 'These are some of the poorest households in the world, and, ironically, some of the hungriest as well, despite being food producers.', 'They are hungry because they lack the ability to buy high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation equipment, and other tools needed to increase productivity.', 'As a result, their output is meager and insufficient for their subsistence.', 'Their poverty causes low farm productivity, and low farm productivity reinforces their poverty.', 'It‚Äôs a vicious circle, technically known as a poverty trap.', 'The UN Millennium Project‚Äôs Hunger Task Force, led by two world-leading scientists, M. S. Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez, examined how to break this vicious circle.', 'The Hunger Task Force determined that Africa could substantially increase its food production if help was given to smallholder farmers, in the form of agricultural inputs. The Millennium Project recommended a big increase in global funding for this purpose. Drawing on that work and related scientific findings, Annan launched a call in 2004 for an African Green Revolution, based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries.', 'Many of us, notably current UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, have worked hard to make this possible, with Ban repeatedly emphasizing the special emergency arising from the global food, financial, and energy crises of the past two years.', 'The G-8 announcement reflects these years of effort, and of course the boost from the leadership of US President Barack Obama, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, World Bank President Robert Zoellick, European Commissioner Louis Michel, European Parliamentarian Thijs Berman, and others.', 'Now the key is to make this effort work.', 'The lessons of history are clear.', 'Getting seed and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized prices (or even free in some cases) will make a lasting difference.', 'Not only will food yields rise in the short term, but farm households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumulate all sorts of assets: cash balances, soil nutrients, farm animals, and their children‚Äôs health and education.', 'That boost in assets will, in turn, enable local credit markets, such as micro-finance, to begin operating.', 'Farmers will be able to buy inputs, either out of their own cash, or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness.', 'A consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders, but obstacles remain.', 'Perhaps the main risk is that the ‚Äúaid bureaucracies‚Äù now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the $20 billion, so that much of it gets taken up by meetings, expert consultations, overhead, reports, and further meetings.', '‚ÄúPartnerships‚Äù of donors can become an expensive end in themselves, merely delaying real action.', 'If donor governments really want results, they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places, the most logical being the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in Rome.', 'One or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars.', 'Governments in hunger-stricken regions, especially Africa, would then submit national action plans that would provide details on how they would use the donor funds to get high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, farm tools, storage silos, and local advice to impoverished farmers.', 'An independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and managerial coherence.', 'Assuming that a plan passes muster, the money to support it would quickly be disbursed.', 'Afterward, each national program would be monitored, audited, and evaluated.', 'This approach is straightforward, efficient, accountable, and scientifically sound.', 'Two major recent success stories in aid have used this approach: the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunizations, which successfully gets immunizations to young children, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, which supports national action plans to battle these killer diseases.', 'Both have saved millions of lives during the past decade, and have paved the way to a new more efficient and scientifically sound method of development assistance.', 'Not surprisingly, many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach.', 'All too often, the fight is about turf, rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor.', 'Obama, Rudd, Zapatero, and other forward-thinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by following up on their pledges at the G-8 and insisting that the aid really works.', 'The bureaucracies must be bypassed to get help to where it is needed: in the soil tilled by the world‚Äôs poorest farm families.', '', 'A Black

Crowley was, need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the finer houses of Cambridge, or any other American city.', 'But is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion?', 'One might argue that it was.', 'If not Professor Gates, then who?', 'Precisely because he is a grandee, he is in the position to draw national attention to a serious issue.', 'If the same thing had happened to an unknown man in Harlem, or some other poor, or predominantly black district, no one would ever have heard about it.', 'The fact that it happened to a professor in Cambridge makes everyone sit up and take notice.', 'There is, however, a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race.', 'By having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse.', 'Indeed, we don‚Äôt even know for certain whether this was such an instance.', 'Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates‚Äô skin.', 'There was no question of violence.', 'There were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect, on the part of the professor, and of the cop.', 'Outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless, poor, anonymous people, whom most of us find it too easy to ignore.', '', 'A Bollywood Bride for Sarkozy?', 'PARIS -- Ever since French President Nicolas Sarkozy took himself off his country‚Äôs most-eligible-bachelor list by publicly acknowledging his affair with supermodel-turned-pop-musician Carla Bruni during a romantic trip to Euro Disney, he‚Äôs run into trouble.', 'His ratings have dipped below 50% for the first time.', 'Older French citizens don‚Äôt find the public spectacle of their leader in love very amusing.', 'Abroad, Egyptian lawmakers were so exercised over the prospect of the French head of state sharing a bed with his girlfriend that several vented their disapproval on the floor of the parliament.', 'Likewise, India is all in a quandary over how to handle protocol during Sarkozy‚Äôs impending visit to the subcontinent as the guest of honor at the country‚Äôs Republic Day celebrations on January 26.', 'Should the First Girlfriend have her own motorcade, as a first lady would?', 'Meanwhile, the same hard-right Hindu groups that protest Valentine‚Äôs Day as a decadent Western holiday have warned that if Sarkozy arrives with his girlfriend in tow, they‚Äôll be out in the streets to welcome him.', 'This controversy has threatened to cast a pall over a much-heralded summit between two of the world‚Äôs great democracies.', 'With lucrative deals at stake for the big-ticket products that drive the French economy ‚Äì military hardware, nuclear power plants, and Airbus planes ‚Äì France has a strong interest in a successful summit in India.', 'So, as rumors fly of secret marriage ceremonies either already concluded or in the works, could the trouble brewing in India over the French president‚Äôs very public love life be behind the rush to have the couple legally wed?', 'The news in Sarkozy‚Äôs favored media outlet Journal du Dimanche that the couple plan to marry touched off a flurry of fevered speculation on when the happy event might occur.', 'The couple exchanged significant tokens of their mutual affection: he offered her a heart-shaped pink diamond ring by Dior, she offered him a Swiss watch.', 'It‚Äôs ‚Äúserious,‚Äù the smitten president admitted.', 'But he refused, even under direct questioning by reporters, to reveal an exact date.', '‚ÄúYou‚Äôll probably find out after it‚Äôs happened,‚Äù he taunted.', 'Rumor has it the couple has set February 8 or 9 for the wedding.

Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan has ‚Äì it must be hoped ‚Äì made clear once and for all that the purported blessings of the nuclear age are mere illusions: nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap.', 'Indeed, the opposite is true.', 'Nuclear power is saddled with three major unresolved risks: plant safety, nuclear waste, and, most menacing of all, the risk of military proliferation.', 'Moreover, the alternatives to nuclear energy ‚Äì and to fossil fuels ‚Äì are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable.', 'Taking on nuclear risk is not a necessity; it is a deliberate political choice.', 'Fossil-fuel and nuclear energy belong to the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which were based on a belief in the innocence of the technologically feasible and on the fact that, at the time, only a minority of people worldwide, largely in the West, benefited from technological progress.', 'By contrast, the twenty-first century will be informed by the realization that the global ecosystem and its resources, which are indispensable for human survival, are finite, and that this implies an enduring responsibility to preserve what we have.', 'Meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity.', 'The energy future of nine billion people, which is what the world population will be in the middle of the century, lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear energy, but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency.', 'We already know this.', 'Why, then, do the most advanced countries, in particular, take on the risk of a mega-catastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission?', 'The answer, ultimately, doesn‚Äôt lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy, but first and foremost with its military applications.', 'The energy derived from splitting uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon, the atomic bomb.', 'Being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and prestige.', 'Even today, the Bomb divides the world into two classes: the few states have it, and the many that do not.', 'The old Cold War world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers, the United States and Soviet Union.', 'To stop others from trying to become nuclear powers, which would have multiplied and spread the risk of nuclear confrontation, the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was framed in the 1960‚Äôs.', 'To this day, it governs the relationships between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world, imposing renunciation on the have-nots and nuclear-disarmament obligations on the haves.', 'Of course, the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it.', 'To this day, therefore, the risk remains that the number of nuclear powers will increase, particularly given small and medium powers‚Äô hope to enhance their prestige and position in regional conflicts.', 'Iran is the most current example of this.', 'The nuclearization of these not-always-stable states threatens to make the regional conflicts of the twenty-first century much more dangerous, and will also substantially increase the risk that nuclear weapons eventually end up in the hands of terrorists.', 'Despite the NPT, a clear separation between civilian and military use of nuclear energy hasn‚Äôt always worked, or worked completely, because the NPT‚Äôs rules permit all signatory states to develop and use ‚Äì under international supervision ‚Äì all of the components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes.', 'From here, then, all that is required to become a nuclear power are a few small technical steps and political leaders‚Äô decision to take them.', 'This political power, not the requirements of energy policy, is what makes giving up nuclear energy so difficult.', 'As a rule, the path to nuclear-power status always begins with so-called ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù nuclear programs.', 'The supposed ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù nuclear ambitions of Iran have thus, for instance, led to a large number of such ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù programs in neighboring states.', 'Honni soit qui mal y pense!', 'And, of course, the reactions of the nuclear powers to the disaster at Fukushima will be watched and analyzed closely by the so-called ‚Äúclandestine threshold countries.‚Äù', 'So how will the world ‚Äì first and foremost, the main nuclear powers ‚Äì react to the Fukushima disaster?', 'Will the tide truly turn, propelling the world towards nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear weapons?', 'Or will we witness attempts to downplay the calamity and return to business as usual as soon as possible?', 'Fukushima has presented the world with a far-reaching, fundamental choice.', 'It was Japan, the high-tech country par excellence (not the latter-day Soviet Union) that proved unable to take adequate precautions to avert disaster in four reactor blocks.', 'What, then, will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin ‚Äì with the active assistance of the nuclear powers ‚Äì to acquire civilian nuclear-energy capabilities?', 'Any decision to continue as before would send an unambiguous message to the clandestine threshold countries that are secretly pursuing nuclear weapons: despite lofty rhetoric and wordy documents, the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course.', 'Were they to abandon nuclear energy, however, their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security ‚Äì and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation.', '', 'A Born-Again CAP', 'WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS ‚Äì Born in 1957, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is now more than 50 years old, and the European Commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its middle-aged child.', 'But superficial repairs will not meet the European Union‚Äôs future needs.', 'The CAP must be born again.', 'Work on its renewal is due to start now, with the completed project ready in 2013.', 'But a much more profound re-think is needed.', 'The CAP‚Äôs original aim was to provide a secure source of food for the six original member states of the Union, which were importers of food and sought a degree of self-sufficiency.', 'Good, healthy, and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens.', 'Improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the Union‚Äôs growing wealth.', 'Instruments to achieve those objectives were developed, and food security was achieved.', 'The CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project.', 'As the EU has evolved and expanded, food systems have become more complex, involving production, processing, supply-chain organization, and wholesale and retail distribution, with all of these involving new issues like health and the environment.', 'The use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny.', 'A 1991 study by the Netherlands Scientific Council for Governmental Policy, entitled Ground for Choices, demonstrated that the EU‚Äôs food supply could be met with 50% less cultivated land, 80% less pesticides, and at 50% less cost.', 'Pollution would be reduced by 70% as a result of fewer nitrates in the surface water, and greenhouse gases would be cut.', 'Those figures were for an EU of 15 countries, so with today‚Äôs 27 members the possibilities are even greater.', 'A Dutch analysis of land use has shown that by employing the best technical and ecological means on the best available land, substantial gains could be made in food production.', 'So it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially.', 'Viewed from the standpoint of food security and the wealth of rural areas, there is now an urgent need to revisit the CAP‚Äôs main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced.', 'Perverse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favoring products such as bio-fuels reconsidered.', 'The status quo clearly has to be changed.', 'Rural policy in the EU is too often reduced to income guarantees for the farming community.', 'But that attitude is undermining change.', 'Competition must be encouraged, as more rural entrepreneurship will strengthen the farming community, with fewer farmers but better farms.', 'A simplified CAP would encourage cleaner, more productive, and efficient agriculture.', 'A side benefit for the EU‚Äôs standing in the world could be that the World Trade Organization‚Äôs stalled Doha negotiations could be restarted once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from Europe.', 'Moreover, the CAP‚Äôs role as a motor of political and social integration in Europe could be restored once renewed policies are in place.', 'But renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces, as the results might not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society.', 'If the market ‚Äúmisbehaves,‚Äù farmers could be reduced to poverty, leading to the neglect of large areas of Europe.', 'That is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars.', '1. The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens European agriculture‚Äôs competitiveness.', 'Such a policy has been successful in the Netherlands, substantially contributing to the development and power of the country‚Äôs agribusiness.', 'Ten of 21 branches of Dutch agribusiness, including horticultural seeds, ornamentals, seed potatoes, and veal, are among the top contributors to the national economy and the country‚Äôs trade balance.', 'In the EU as a whole, a policy directed toward research programs stimulating scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system would greatly strengthen agriculture‚Äôs competitiveness and contribute to food security and sustainable development.', '2. Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use.', 'Many structural improvement programs have been financed at the European level, but agricultural production and land use are not among them.', 'The development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure.', 'Reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy.', '3. A policy for European food systems would treat production, processing, distribution, logistics, and retailing in combination.', 'Consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems.', 'Preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation‚Äôs ‚ÄúForward Look on European Food Systems‚Äù could prove useful in devising an EU-wide policy.', '4. Metropolitan agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide high-quality produce on small amounts of land.', 'It offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects.', '5. A new CAP should include a policy to safeguard Europe‚Äôs landscapes.', 'But a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere, nor should it ignore cost.', 'And it should not be a defensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on poor-quality land.', 'These five pillars involve drastic choices, but they will probably require less money from Europe‚Äôs taxpayers, not more.', 'They could make a real contribution to cleaner, more productive, and efficient farming and land use, while addressing social needs.', '', 'How Abortion Hypocrisy Kills Women', 'KISUMU, KENYA ‚Äì Opposition to abortion is so intense that even where women have the legal right to terminate their pregnancy, it can be extremely difficult to access the services needed to exercise that right.', 'But, worse than that, opponents of abortion tend to ignore the failures that lead women to the point where they seek one in the first place.', \"Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader, the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to additional Iranian provocations.\", 'And that shift would occur at a time of growing challenges to US interests elsewhere in the world.', \"The targeted killing by the United States of one of Iran's top military leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the Iranian regime, but it does not augur all-out war.\", 'After all, Iran and the US have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest in an uncontrolled military escalation now.', 'As in previous years, Project Syndicate asked its commentators to offer their best guesses about the events and trends that will define the coming 12 months.', \"If there is one common theme in this year's selection, it is that what happens in 2020 will weigh on the present for many years to come.\", 'From a moral standpoint, there is a strong case to be made for respecting a woman‚Äôs personal freedom and bodily autonomy, rather than forcing her to put her health or wellbeing at risk by carrying an unwanted or unsafe pregnancy to term.', 'Yet, given how rife with misinformation and muddied by misplaced arguments the issue is, policy debates often go nowhere unless they frame abortion first and foremost as a health matter.', 'Consider the case of Kenya.', 'Despite having one of Africa‚Äôs most progressive abortion laws ‚Äì a woman has the right to terminate a pregnancy if ‚Äúthere is need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other written law‚Äù ‚Äì enduring opposition to abortion has undermined implementation.', 'And this is to say nothing of the women who would not qualify for an abortion under these rules.', 'But it is well documented that outlawing abortion does not end the practice.', 'Rather, when the authorities jail anyone who is rumored to be providing safe abortions, as occurs in Kenya, women end up turning to providers who use highly dangerous methods to get the job done.', 'For example, they perforate women‚Äôs uteruses with sharp objects, sit on women‚Äôs bellies to eject the fetus, and prescribe unsafe concoctions.', 'To avoid these back-alley providers, women try to induce abortions by ingesting large amounts of painkillers or poisoning themselves with detergents.', 'Some die; others are left with no uterus; still others are left managing complications like cervicovaginal fistulas.', 'After years working in reproductive health, I can say authoritatively that women do not terminate pregnancies on a whim.', 'They do not pay an unqualified person to stab their uterus because the mood strikes them.', 'Condemning them will not change their minds; nor will prioritizing the development of a fetus over the needs, rights, and wellbeing of its mother.', 'All it will do is make them more likely to risk their health and lives seeking an unsafe abortion.', 'If we want to reduce demand for abortion services, we must recognize that it is often the culmination of a series of systemic failures that begin during childhood, when a comprehensive sexual education (CSE) should be required.', 'A CSE teaches young people about sex and relationships in an age-appropriate, culturally sensitive, realistic, nonjudgmental, and scientifically accurate way, and can increase the use of contraceptives and reduce teen pregnancy rates, particularly if it takes a gender-based approach, focusing on empowering young girls to protect their own health.', 'Such an education is not a privilege, but a right.', 'In Kenya, Article 35 of the constitution guarantees every citizen ‚Äúthe right of access to information held by another person and required for the exercise or protection of any right or fundamental freedom.‚Äù', 'This includes the right to reproductive health care, enshrined in Article 43.', 'But, like the right to abortion, the right to CSE is often not respected, owing to moralizing resistance from religious leaders and anti-choice movements, as well as other factors, such as weak dissemination of the curriculum and a dearth of adequately trained teachers.', 'As a result, myths and misconceptions remain widespread.', 'This, together with funding shortages and cultural factors (such as a lack of male involvement in reproductive-health issues), contribute to low contraceptive uptake, with only 58% of women in Kenya who should be using modern contraceptives actually doing so.', 'Unsurprisingly, teenage pregnancy is unacceptably high.', 'It is time to address the systemic failures that lead to girls and women ending up maimed or dead.', 'Here, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure: contraception in health budgets, quality CSE in schools, and youth-friendly reproductive-health services.', 'But the cure must also be an option.', 'Rules that punish women must be replaced with modern laws ‚Äì in line with international human-rights frameworks ‚Äì that protect women‚Äôs reproductive freedom, including by guaranteeing access to safe abortion services.', 'Written guidelines to end the victimization of abortion service providers are also needed.', 'How can a government that fails to ensure CSE or invest adequately in family planning penalize its women for unwanted pregnancies?', 'How can a society that ignores women‚Äôs suffering blame the victims for its inaction?', 'Those who do nothing to prevent unwanted pregnancies ‚Äì and everything to punish the women affected by them ‚Äì cannot claim the moral high ground.', '', 'A Boycott Against Reason', '‚ÄúIt could happen here‚Äù is the shorthand phrase frequently used for a variety of alarming hypothetical scenarios.', '‚ÄúHow could this happen here?‚Äù was the question more pertinently asked in Great Britain recently, as its universities witnessed the unfolding of an all-too-real and perplexing action.', 'In early June, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE), Britain‚Äôs largest academic union, with 67,000 members, passed a motion to sever ties with all Israeli professors and institutions of higher learning unless they publicly dissociate themselves from ‚Äúcontinuing Israeli apartheid policies.‚Äù', 'The motion was subsequently revoked; but the fact that it was put forward at all is astonishing enough.', 'Indeed, the union‚Äôs call for a wholesale boycott contravened its most fundamental values: the principle of academic freedom, openness, and exchange; protection of research from state politics; and the fundamental right to free speech.', 'The motion implicitly adopted the yardstick of collective punishment and a distinctly McCarthyite tone, demanding a sort of ‚Äúdisloyalty oath‚Äù from Israeli academics.', 'What led scholars who are putatively the guardians of democratic freedoms to embrace measures so reminiscent of fascist and Stalinist tactics?', 'Unfortunately, the NATFHE effort is part of a larger phenomenon.', 'In 2005, the Association of University Teachers (AUT) called for a more limited boycott, singling out Bar Ilan and Haifa Universities for opprobrium.', 'Before that, a petition, signed by roughly 80 prominent British intellectuals and a few from other European countries, demanded the cessation of European Union funding for Israeli cultural projects and institutions.', 'These campaigns, encouraged by Palestinian groups and non-governmental organizations, have been accompanied by individual acts of professional ostracism, and an informal boycott of Israeli scholars, publications, and cultural projects already exists in some European circles.', 'Such developments suggest an advanced and deeply disturbing trend, whereby certain segments of the European intelligentsia are willing to violate their own beliefs in order to target one state for unique stigmatization; and whereby insidious and sometimes illegal forms of discrimination against that state‚Äôs citizens are increasingly seen as acceptable.', 'In a certain ideological mind-set, Israel is perceived not as a political entity, susceptible to prevailing standards of judgment, but as an almost allegorical force, the symbolic center and source of the globe‚Äôs evils and ailments.', 'Of course, Israel has been guilty of both bad policies and political sins.', 'The occupation of Palestinian territories has had terrible consequences, and it is necessary to end it.', 'But in today‚Äôs intensely charged climate, the Middle East has become a kind of ideological projection screen, a magnet for tendencies to demonization and idealization.', 'In the putatively ‚Äúradical‚Äù interpretation, the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians is rarely seen as a conflict between two groups with sometimes tragically opposed interests.', 'Rather, the stubborn complexities of the situation are reduced to a stark struggle between absolute power and absolute powerlessness, the archetypal oppressor and archetypal oppressed.', 'The rhetoric applied to Israel becomes ever more extreme, and conducive to hatred.', 'Phrases like ‚Äúapartheid state‚Äù and ‚ÄúZionism is racism,‚Äù unthinkable in liberal discourse a few years ago, have become routine.', 'At the same time, the Palestinians become objects of romanticized identifications ‚Äì one of the leaders of the NAFTHE motion was seen, prior to a meeting, draped in a Palestinian flag ‚Äì and unwitting condescension.', 'They are seen as the last pure cause, the entirely innocent ‚ÄúOther,‚Äù unimplicated in their fate and apparently deprived of political agency or choice.', 'The possibility that the Palestinians are capable of deliberate decisions, that they have adopted policies which may have contributed to the current situation, or that they have exercised their own forms of power and violence, is, in this framework, never admitted.', 'Hamas was never mentioned in either of the university unions‚Äô motions.', 'This is Manicheanism of the left, and, like Manicheanism of the political right, it can distort reality to the point of becoming divorced from it.', 'Certainly, the boycott efforts ignored basic facts.', 'Unless British academics are ill informed, they know that Israel, far from being an ‚Äúapartheid state,‚Äù has a large proportion of Arab citizens; that Israeli universities are well integrated, in some cases with considerable numbers of Arab students, as well as a number ‚Äì admittedly small and insufficiently representative ‚Äì of Arab faculty; that many universities sponsor collaborative projects with Palestinian and Arab colleagues; that they are often sites of dissidence against government policies; and that such dissidence, even in radical forms, is tolerated.', 'Advocates of discriminatory measures often charge their opponents with stifling legitimate criticism of Israel.', 'This argument is both disingenuous and dishonest.', 'Many of the boycotts‚Äô critics are also critical of Israel.', 'But credible criticism must be based on evidence ‚Äì and on generally applicable criteria of judgment.', 'If the British unions wanted to be ethically consistent, they should apply the same strategies to universities in the numerous countries where human rights are brutally abused and free speech suppressed.', 'Some see this hostility to Israel as camouflaging old-fashioned anti-Semitism.', 'It is always risky to speculate about hidden motives; nevertheless, systematic disparagement of Israeli society and culture undoubtedly encourages the sense that anti-Semitism, too, is a permitted prejudice.', 'It is always easier to see a group or nation as a malevolent ‚ÄúOther‚Äù when this impulse is fed by an old, and still potent, prejudice.', 'There is a deeper issue at stake.', 'Democratic societies depend not only on the foundational principle of free speech, but on the character of political thought and conversation among various constituencies.', 'When the supposedly most enlightened and liberal of those constituencies resorts to illiberal discourse and intolerant measures, tendencies toward bigotry and ideological irrationality are reinforced.', 'The actions of the British academic unions have Israel as their obvious target.', 'But their main effect may be an erosion of reasoned debate and civil conduct, without which democracy is powerless against the forces of polarization and extremism.', '', 'A Breakthrough Against Hunger', 'NEW YORK ‚Äì Today‚Äôs world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures.', 'Nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger ‚Äì perhaps 100 million more than two years ago.', 'Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action.', 'With Spain‚Äôs leadership and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon‚Äôs partnership, several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world‚Äôs poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty trap.', 'The benefits of some donor help can be remarkable.', 'Peasant farmers in Africa, Haiti, and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-yield seed varieties and fertilizers.', 'The result is a grain yield (for example, maize) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs.', 'African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare, compared with more than four tons per hectare in China, where farmers use fertilizers heavily.', 'African farmers know that they need fertilizer; they just can‚Äôt afford it.', 'With donor help, they can.', 'Not only do these farmers then feed their families, but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future.', 'By building up savings over a few years, the farmers eventually become creditworthy, or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own.', 'There is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers (those with two hectares or less of land, or impoverished pastoralists), which is especially urgent in Africa.', 'The UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around $8 billion per year in donor financing ‚Äì roughly four times the current total ‚Äì with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and extension training.', 'In addition to direct help for small farms, donors should provide more help for the research and development needed to identify new high-yielding seed varieties, especially to breed plants that can withstand temporary flooding, excess nitrogen, salty soils, crop pests, and other challenges to sustainable food production.', 'Helping the poor with today‚Äôs technologies, while investing in future improved technologies, is the optimum division of labor.', 'This investment pays off wonderfully, with research centers such as the International Rice Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre providing the high-yield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the Asian Green Revolution.', 'These centers are not household names, but they deserve to be.', 'Their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world, and we‚Äôll need more of them.', 'Dozens of low-income, food-deficit countries, perhaps as many as 40-50, have elaborated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms, but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding.', 'These countries have appealed to the World Bank for financing, and the Bank made a valiant effort in 2008 to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFCRP).', 'But the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries‚Äô urgent needs, and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used.', 'Hundreds of millions of people, in the meantime, remain trapped in hunger.', 'Many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture, but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so.', 'The current aid structures are inadequate.', 'The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively.', 'Despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals, the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate.', 'The 2008 planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers.', 'African countries search endlessly, and mostly fruitlessly, for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds.', 'My colleagues and I, serving on an advisory committee for the Spanish initiative, have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account, which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism (FCM).', 'These pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer, improved seed varieties, and small-scale irrigation equipment that they urgently need.', 'Poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account, rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors.', 'By pooling financial resources into a single-donor FCM, aid programs‚Äô administrative costs could be kept low, the availability of aid flows could be assured, and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times in order to receive help.', 'The time for business as usual is over.', 'The donors promised to double aid to Africa by 2010, but are still far off track.', 'Indeed, during the past 20 years, they actually cut aid for agriculture programs, and only now are reversing course.', 'Meanwhile, a billion people go hungry each day.', 'We need a breakthrough that is demonstrable, public, clear, and convincing, that can mobilize the public‚Äôs hearts and minds, and that can demonstrate success.', 'History can be made in Madrid at the end of January, when the world‚Äôs richest and poorest countries converge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis.', 'The lives of the billion poorest people depend on it.', '', 'A Breakthrough Opportunity for Global Health', 'NEW YORK ‚Äì Every year, millions of people die from preventable and treatable diseases, especially in poor countries.', 'In many cases, lifesaving medicines can be cheaply mass-produced, but are sold at prices that block access to those who need them.', 'And many die simply because there are no cures or vaccines, because so little of the world‚Äôs valuable research talent and limited resources is devoted to addressing the diseases of the poor.', 'This state of affairs represents a failure of economics and law that urgently needs to be corrected.', 'The good news is that there are now opportunities for change, most promisingly through an international effort headed by the World Health Organization that would begin to fix the broken intellectual-property regime that is holding back the development and availability of cheap drugs.', 'Two main problems limit the availability of medicines today.', 'One is that they are very costly; or, more accurately, the price charged for them is very high, though the cost of producing them is but a fraction of that amount.', 'Second, drug development is geared toward maximizing profit, not social benefit, which skews efforts directed at the creation of medicines that are essential to human welfare.', 'Because the poor have so little money to spend, drug companies, under current arrangements, have little incentive to do research on the diseases that afflict them.', 'It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way.', 'Drug companies argue that high prices are necessary to fund research and development.', 'But, in the United States, it is actually the government that finances most health-related research and development ‚Äì directly, through public support (National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation), and indirectly, through public purchases of medicine, both in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.', 'Even the part that is not government-financed is not a conventional market; most individuals‚Äô purchases of prescription medicines are covered by insurance.', 'Government finances health-care research because improved medicines are a public good.', 'The resulting knowledge benefits everyone by stopping epidemics and limiting the economic and human toll of widespread illness.', 'Efficiency requires sharing research as widely as possible as soon as it is available.', 'Thomas Jefferson compared knowledge to candles: when one is used to light another, it does not diminish the light of the first.', 'On the contrary, everything becomes brighter.', 'Yet, in America and most of the world, drug prices are still exorbitant and the spread of knowledge is tightly limited.', 'That is because we have created a patent system that gives innovators a temporary monopoly over what they create, which encourages them to hoard their knowledge, lest they help a competitor.', 'While this system does provide incentives for certain kinds of research by making innovation profitable, it allows drug companies to drive up prices, and the incentives do not necessarily correspond to social returns.', 'In the health-care sector, it may be more profitable to devote research to a ‚Äúme-too‚Äù drug than to the development of a treatment that really makes a difference.', 'The patent system may even have adverse effects on innovation, because, while the most important input into any research is prior ideas, the patent system encourages secrecy.', 'A solution to both high prices and misdirected research is to replace the current model with a government-supported prize fund.', 'With a prize system, innovators are rewarded for new knowledge, but they do not retain a monopoly on its use.', 'That way, the power of competitive markets can ensure that, once a drug is developed, it is made available at the lowest possible price ‚Äì not at an inflated monopoly price.', 'Fortunately, some US lawmakers are taking a strong interest in this approach.', 'The Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS Act, a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, is just such an initiative.', 'His bill also contains an important provision aimed at encouraging open-source research, which would move the current research model away from secrecy toward sharing.', 'But, globally, our innovation system needs much bigger changes.', 'The WHO‚Äôs efforts to encourage broad reforms at the international level are crucial.', 'This spring, the WHO released a report that recommends solutions similar to those proposed in the US Senate bill, but on a global level.', 'Importantly, the report, ‚ÄúResearch and Development to Meet Health Needs in Developing Countries,‚Äù recommends a comprehensive approach, including mandatory funding contributions from governments for research on developing countries‚Äô health needs; international coordination of health-care priorities and implementation; and a global observatory that would monitor where needs are greatest.', 'In late May, the international community will have a chance to begin implementing these ideas at the WHO World Health Assembly ‚Äì a moment of hope for public health around the world.', 'Reforming our innovation system is not just a matter of economics.', 'It is, in many cases, a matter of life and death.', 'It is therefore essential to de-link R&D incentives from drug prices, and to promote greater sharing of scientific knowledge.', 'For America, the Sanders bill marks important progress.', 'For the world, the WHO‚Äôs recommendations represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remedy a long-standing and egregious inequity in health care, and, more broadly, to set a model for governance of global public goods befitting an era of globalization.', 'We cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by.', '', 'India‚Äôs Change of Guard', 'SINGAPORE

species, human beings have a major self-control problem.', 'We humans are now so aggressively fishing, hunting, logging, and growing crops in all parts of the world that we are literally chasing other species off the planet.', 'Our intense desire to take all that we can from nature leaves precious little for other forms of life.', 'In 1992, when the world‚Äôs governments first promised to address man-made global warming, they also vowed to head off the human-induced extinction of other species.', 'The Convention on Biological Diversity, agreed at the Rio Earth Summit, established that ‚Äúbiological diversity is a common concern of humanity.‚Äù', 'The signatories agreed to conserve biological diversity, by saving species and their habitats, and to use biological resources (e.g., forests) in a sustainable manner.', 'In 2002, the treaty‚Äôs signatories went further, committing to ‚Äúa significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss‚Äù by 2010.', 'Unfortunately, like so many other international agreements, the Convention on Biological Diversity remains essentially unknown, un-championed, and unfulfilled.', 'That neglect is a human tragedy.', 'For a very low cash outlay ‚Äì and perhaps none at all on balance ‚Äì we could conserve nature and thus protect the basis of our own lives and livelihoods.', 'We kill other species not because we must, but because we are too negligent to do otherwise.', 'Consider a couple of notorious examples.', 'Some rich countries, such as Spain, Portugal, Australia, and New Zealand, have fishing fleets that engage in so-called ‚Äúbottom trawling.‚Äù', 'Bottom trawlers drag heavy nets over the ocean bottom, destroying magnificent, unexplored, and endangered marine species in the process.', 'Complex and unique ecologies, most notably underground volcanoes known as seamounts, are ripped to shreds, because bottom trawling is the ‚Äúlow cost‚Äù way to catch a few deep sea fish species.', 'One of these species, orange roughy, has been caught commercially for only around a quarter-century, but already is being fished to the point of collapse.', 'Likewise, in many parts of the world, tropical rainforest is being cleared for pasture land and food crops.', 'The result is massive loss of habitat and destruction of species, yielding a tiny economic benefit at a huge social cost.', 'After cutting down a swath of rainforest, soils are often quickly leached of their nutrients so that they cannot sustain crops or nutritious grasses for livestock.', 'As a result, the new pasture land or farmland is soon abandoned, with no prospect for regeneration of the original forest and its unique ecosystems.', 'Because these activities‚Äô costs are so high and their benefits so low, stopping them would be easy.', 'Bottom trawling should simply be outlawed; it would be simple and inexpensive to compensate the fishing industry during a transition to other activities.', 'Forest clearing, on the other hand, is probably best stopped by economic incentives, perhaps combined with regulatory limits.', 'Simply restricting the practice of land clearing probably would not work, since farm families and communities would face a strong temptation to evade legal limits.', 'On the other hand, financial incentives would probably succeed, because cutting down forest to create pastureland is not profitable enough to induce farmers to forego payments for protecting the land.', 'Many rainforest countries have united in recent years to suggest the establishment of a rainforest conservation fund by the rich countries, to pay impoverished small farmers a small amount of money to preserve the forest.', 'A well-designed fund would slow or stop deforestation, preserve biodiversity, and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide the burning of cleared forests.', 'At the same time, small farmers would receive a steady flow of income, which they could use for micro-investments to improve their household‚Äôs wealth, education, and health.', 'Aside from banning bottom trawling and establishing a global fund for avoided deforestation, we should designate a global network of protected marine areas, in which fishing, boating, polluting, dredging, drilling, and other damaging activities would be prohibited.', 'Such areas not only permit the regeneration of species, but also provide ecological benefits that spill over to neighboring unprotected areas.', 'We also need a regular scientific process to present the world with the evidence on species abundance and extinction, just as we now have such a process for climate change.', 'Politicians don‚Äôt listen very well to individual scientists, but they are forced to listen when hundreds of scientists speak with a united voice.', 'Finally, the world should negotiate a new framework no later than 2010 to slow human-induced climate change.', 'There can be little doubt that climate change poses one of the greatest risks to species‚Äô viability.', 'As the planet warms, and rain and storm patterns change dramatically, many species will find themselves in climate zones that no longer support their survival.', 'Some can migrate, but others (such as polar bears) are likely to be driven to extinction unless we take decisive action to head off climate change.', 'These measures are achievable by 2010.', 'They are affordable, and in each case would ultimately deliver large net benefits.', 'Most importantly, they would allow us to follow through on a global promise.', 'It is too painful to believe that humanity would destroy millions of other species ‚Äì and jeopardize our own future ‚Äì in a fit of absent-mindedness.', '', 'Making Do With More', 'BERKELEY ‚Äì In the United States, just three out of ten workers are needed to produce and deliver the goods we consume.', \"Everything we extract, grow, design, build, make, engineer, and transport ‚Äì down to brewing a cup of coffee in a restaurant kitchen and carrying it to a customer's table ‚Äì is done by roughly 30% of the country's workforce.\", 'The rest of us spend our time planning what to make, deciding where to install the things we have made, performing personal services, talking to each other, and keeping track of what is being done, so that we can figure out what needs to be done next.', 'And yet, despite our obvious ability to produce much more than we need, we do not seem to be blessed with an embarrassment of riches.', 'One of the great paradoxes of our time is that workers and middle-class households continue to struggle in a time of unparalleled plenty.', 'We in the developed countries have more than enough to cover our basic needs.', 'We have enough organic carbon-hydrogen bonds to break to provide us with calories; enough vitamins and other nutrients to keep us healthy; enough shelter to keep us dry; enough clothing to keep us warm; enough capital to keep us, at least potentially, productive; and enough entertainment to keep us from being bored.', 'And we produce all of it for an average of less than two hours a day of work outside the home.', 'John Maynard Keynes was not off by much when he famously predicted in 1930 that the human race\\'s ‚Äúeconomic problem, the struggle for subsistence,\" was likely to be ‚Äúsolved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years.\"', 'It will take another generation, perhaps, before robots have completely taken over manufacturing, kitchen work, and construction; and the developing world looks to be 50 years behind.', \"But Keynes would have been spot on had he targeted his essay at his readers' great-great-great-great grandchildren.\", 'And yet there are few signs that working- and middle-class Americans are living any better than they did 35 years ago.', 'Even stranger, productivity growth does not seem to be soaring, as one would expect; in fact, it seems to be decelerating, according to research by John Fernald and Bing Wang, economists in the Economic Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.', 'Growth prospects are even worse, as innovation hits gale-force headwinds.', 'One way to reconcile the changes in the job market with our lived experience and statistics like these is to note that much of what we are producing is very different from what we have made in the past.', 'For most of human experience, the bulk of what we produced could not be easily shared or used without permission.', 'The goods we made were what economists call ‚Äúrival\" and ‚Äúexcludible\" commodities.', 'Being ‚Äúrival\" means that two people cannot use the same product at the same time.', 'Being ‚Äúexcludible\" means that the owner of a product can easily prevent others from using it.', 'These two traits put a great deal of bargaining power in the hands of those who control production and distribution, making them ideal for a market economy based on private property.', 'Money naturally flows to where utility and value are being provided ‚Äì and those flows are easy to track in national accounts.', 'But much of what we are producing in the information age is neither rival nor excludible ‚Äì and this changes the entire picture.', 'The creation of information-age goods is difficult to incentivize; their distribution is hard to monetize; and we lack the tools to track them easily in national accounts.', 'The result is an ever-growing discrepancy between what people would be willing to pay for a given service and growth as measured in national statistics.', 'In other words, we are producing and consuming much more than our economic indicators suggest ‚Äì and the creators of many of those products are not being adequately compensated.', 'This produces a set of unique problems.', 'To ensure that the workers of today and tomorrow are able to capture the benefits of the information age will require us to redesign our economic system to stimulate the creation of these new types of commodities.', 'In addition to developing ways to account for this new type of wealth, we will have to develop channels through which demand for a product contributes to the income of its creator.', 'Only by finding ways to put true value on the goods we produce will we be able to sustain a middle-class society, rather than one of techno-plutocrats and their service-sector serfs.', '', 'Making Academia Matter Again', 'CAMBRIDGE ‚Äì Academic freedom is a precious commodity, critical to ensure that discovery of the truth is not encumbered by political or ideological forces.', 'But this does not mean that intellectuals should hide in academic bunkers that, by protecting us from criticism by ‚Äúnon-experts,‚Äù allow ego to flourish and enable a focus on questions that are not actually relevant to anyone else.', 'We experts should have to explain ourselves.', 'This means, first and foremost, that researchers should be communicating their results in a way that supports accountability and confirms that public funds and education benefits are being used in ways that are in taxpayers‚Äô interests.', 'The duty to communicate findings also ensures that the public is educated, not only about the topic itself, but also about the way research actually works.', 'Scholarly books and journals often give the impression that the truth is revealed through a neat, orderly, and logical process.', 'But research is far from being a pristine landscape; in fact, it resembles a battlefield, littered with miscalculations, failed experiments, and discarded assumptions.', 'The path to truth is often convoluted, and those who travel along it often must navigate fierce competition and professional intrigue.', 'Some argue that it is better to hide this reality from the public, in order to maintain credibility.', 'For example, in 2014, physicists collaborating on a project known as BICEP2 thought that they had detected gravitational waves from the beginning of the universe.', 'It was later realized that the signal they had detected could be entirely attributed to interstellar dust.', 'Some of my colleagues worried that this revelation would undermine faith in other scientific predictions, such as those involving climate change.', 'But would hiding the truth from the public really do more for scientific and academic credibility than cultivating a culture of transparency?', 'Probably not.', 'In fact, being honest about the realities of research might enhance trust and create more space for innovation, with an informed public accepting that risk is the unavoidable and worthwhile cost of groundbreaking and broadly beneficial discoveries.', 'Another way to ensure that academia continues to innovate in useful and relevant ways is to blur the traditional boundaries among disciplines ‚Äì the frontiers where invention so often happens.', 'To that end, universities should update their organizational structure, moving away from clearly delineated departments in order to create a kind of continuum across the arts, humanities, and sciences.', 'Students should be encouraged to take courses in multiple disciplines, so that they can weave those lessons and experiences into new patterns of knowledge.', 'To make this process sustainable, universities should ensure that the courses and curricula they offer help students to develop the skills that a fast-changing labor market demands.', 'This means not just creating new curricula today, but also updating them every few years, in order to account for new trends and discoveries in areas ranging from artificial intelligence and Big Data to alternative energy sources and genome editing.', 'Professors, for their part, should approach their job as mentors of future leaders in science, technology, the arts, and humanities, rather than attempting to mold students in their own intellectual image.', 'Of course, the latter approach can be useful if the goal is to advance the popularity of one‚Äôs own research program and to ensure that one‚Äôs own ideas and perspective endure.', 'But that is not the fundamental mission of academia.', 'The louder the consensus in the echo chambers of academia become, the greater the ego boost for those who inhabit those chambers.', 'But history shows that progress is sometimes advocated by a soft voice in the background, like that of Albert Einstein during his early career.', 'Truth and consensus are not always the same.', 'Diversity of opinion ‚Äì which implies diversity of gender, ethnicity, and background ‚Äì is vital to support creativity, discovery, and progress.', 'That is why it is so important for prizes and professional associations to be used not to reinforce mainstream perspectives, but rather to encourage independent thought and reward innovation.', 'This does not mean that all opinions should be considered equal, but rather that alternative views should be debated and vetted on merit alone.', 'We in academia cannot continue to pat ourselves on the back, celebrating our own privileges and failing to look at the world in new and relevant ways.', 'If we are to defend the freedom of our enterprise, we must restore dialogue with the broader public and ensure that the relevance of our work is well understood ‚Äì including by us.', '', 'The Closing of the Academic Mind', 'LONDON ‚Äì I would wager that I have been Chancellor of more universities than anyone alive today.', 'This is partly because when I was Governor of Hong Kong, I was made Chancellor of every university in the city.', 'I protested that it would surely be better for the universities to choose their own constitutional heads.', 'But the universities would not allow me to resign gracefully.', 'So for five years I enjoyed the experience of giving tens of thousands of students their degrees and watching what this rite of passage meant for them and their families.', 'When I came back to Britain in 1997, I was asked to become Chancellor of Newcastle University.', 'Then, in 2003, I was elected Chancellor by the graduates of Oxford University, one of the world‚Äôs greatest institutions of learning.', 'So it should not be surprising that I have strong views about what it means to be a university and to teach, do research, or study at one.', 'Universities should be bastions of freedom in any society.', 'They should be free from government interference in their primary purposes of research and teaching; and they should control their own academic governance.', 'I do not believe it is possible for a university to become or remain a world-class institution if these conditions do not exist.', 'The role of a university is to promote the clash of ideas, to test the results of research with other scholars, and to impart new knowledge to students.', 'Freedom of speech is thus fundamental to what universities are, enabling them to sustain a sense of common humanity and uphold the mutual tolerance and understanding that underpin any free society.', 'That, of course, makes universities dangerous to authoritarian governments, which seek to stifle the ability to raise and attempt to answer difficult questions.', 'But if any denial of academic liberty is a blow struck against the meaning of a university, the irony today is that some of the most worrying attacks on these values have been coming from inside universities.', 'In the United States and the United Kingdom, some students and teachers now seek to constrain argument and debate.', 'They contend that people should not be exposed to ideas with which they strongly disagree.', 'Moreover, they argue that history should be rewritten to expunge the names (though not the endowments) of those who fail to pass today‚Äôs tests of political correctness.', 'Thomas Jefferson and Cecil Rhodes, among others, have been targeted.', 'And how would Churchill and Washington fare if the same tests were applied to them?', 'Some people are being denied the chance to speak as well ‚Äì so-called ‚Äúno platforming‚Äù, in the awful jargon of some clearly not very literate campuses.', 'There are calls for ‚Äúsafe spaces‚Äù where students can be protected from anything that assaults their sense of what is moral and appropriate.', 'This reflects and inevitably nurtures a harmful politics of victimization ‚Äì defining one‚Äôs own identity (and thus one‚Äôs interests) in opposition to others.', 'When I was a student 50 years ago, my principal teacher was a leading Marxist historian and former member of the Communist Party.', 'The British security services were deeply suspicious of him.', 'He was a great historian and teacher, but these days I might be encouraged to think that he had threatened my ‚Äúsafe space.‚Äù', 'In fact, he made me a great deal better informed, more open to discussion of ideas that challenged my own, more capable of distinguishing between an argument and a quarrel, and more prepared to think for myself.', 'Of course, some ideas ‚Äì incitement of racial hatred, gender hostility, or political violence ‚Äì are anathema in every free society.', 'Liberty requires some limits (decided freely by democratic argument under the rule of law) in order to exist.', 'Universities should be trusted to exercise that degree of control themselves.', 'But intolerance of debate, of discussion, and of particular branches of scholarship should never be tolerated.', 'As the great political philosopher Karl Popper taught us, the only thing we should be intolerant of is intolerance itself.', 'That is especially true at universities.', 'Yet some American and British academics and students are themselves undermining freedom; paradoxically, they have the liberty to do so.', 'Meanwhile, universities in China and Hong Kong are faced with threats to their autonomy and freedom, not from within, but from an authoritarian government.', 'In Hong Kong, the autonomy of universities and free speech itself, guaranteed in the city‚Äôs Basic Law and the 50-year treaty between Britain and China on the city‚Äôs status, are under threat.', 'The rationale seems to be that, because students strongly supported the pro-democracy protests in 2014, the universities where they study should be brought to heel.', 'So the city‚Äôs government blunders away, stirring up trouble, clearly on the orders of the government in Beijing.', 'Indeed, the Chinese authorities only recently showed what they think of treaty obligations and of the ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù of Sino-British relations (much advertised by British ministers), by abducting a British citizen (and four other Hong Kong residents) on the city‚Äôs streets.', 'The five were publishing books that exposed some of the dirty secrets of China‚Äôs leaders.', 'On the mainland, the Chinese Communist Party has launched the biggest crackdown on universities since the aftermath of the killings in Tiananmen Square in 1989.', 'There is to be no discussion of so-called Western values in China‚Äôs universities.', 'Only Marxism can be taught.', 'Did no one tell President Xi Jinping and his Politburo colleagues where Karl Marx came from?', 'The trouble these days is precisely that they know little about Marx but a lot about Lenin.', 'Westerners should take a closer interest in what is happening in China‚Äôs universities and what that tells us about the real values underpinning scholarship, teaching, and the academy.', 'Compare and contrast, as students are asked to do.', 'Do you want universities where the government decides what it is allegedly safe for you to learn and discuss?', 'Or do you want universities that regard the idea of a ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù ‚Äì in terms of closing down debate in case it offends someone ‚Äì as an oxymoron in an academic setting?', 'Western students should think occasionally about their counterparts in Hong Kong and China who must fight for freedoms that they take for granted ‚Äì and too often abuse.',

would be regarded as productive enough.‚Äù', 'Having published fewer than ten papers since his groundbreaking work in 1964, Higgs believes that no university would employ him nowadays.', 'Academics are well acquainted with the notion of ‚Äúpublish or perish.‚Äù', 'They must publish their work in peer-reviewed journals increasingly often to climb the career ladder, protect their jobs, and secure funding for their institutions.', 'But what happens to scientists and other scholars, such as those in the Middle East, who have different research concerns from ‚Äì and scant connections to ‚Äì the professional journals that can make or break an academic/scientific career?', 'Scholars and institutions with high publishing rates in the established journals receive better productivity scores, which translate into bigger rewards, in terms of enhanced careers and greater research funding.', 'Whether the work they are publishing has a measurable impact on their field of study is, sadly, too often a secondary concern.', 'The incentives they face mean that quantity often comes before quality.', 'Academic journals determine the various disciplinary rankings that academic institutions are compelled to climb, which leads institutions to hire and retain only those scholars who can produce at high rates.', 'This has given rise to a deeper, twofold problem: academic journals have become disproportionately influential, and they have placed a premium on empirical research.', 'With respect to the first problem, journals are gradually replacing institutions as the arbiters of quality within academic communities.', 'Scholars in almost any discipline seeking jobs at ‚ÄúA-level‚Äù institutions must publish in a select few A-level journals that are seen as gateways.', 'These journals‚Äô editorial boards increasingly privilege positivist theoretical work ‚Äì meaning research that is based on empirical data analysis.', 'Qualitative research ‚Äì such as ethnographies, participatory surveys, and case studies ‚Äì is often designated as suitable only for B- and C-level journals.', 'Academics conducting empirical research have a big advantage over those carrying out qualitative work, because they can use efficient software and powerful computers to test their hypotheses quickly and account for different variables in data sets.', 'This kind of work can be cheaper, too, because a single data set can generate multiple journal articles.', 'To be sure, there is nothing wrong with scientific practices evolving along with technology, or with academics using richer data sets and better software.', 'But adoption of this quantitative approach should not be the single most important criterion for assessing scientific excellence and deciding career trajectories.', 'After all, knowledge is acquired in different ways, and empirical positivism is only one method in a larger epistemological inventory.', 'The positivist trend in science today is particularly problematic for developing countries, where data sets are scarce and often of poor quality.', 'Thus, scientists working in developing countries face a dilemma: either work on rich-world problems for which there is abundant data, or risk career advancement by conducting qualitative work that will not make it into A-level journals.', 'Academics who move from data-rich countries in Europe and North America to data-poor countries in the Middle East and elsewhere often face this problem.', 'As researchers at my institution in Abu Dhabi know, conducting surveys for qualitative research is feasible; but generating rich data from scratch for theory-building research is extremely difficult.', 'At the International Conference on Science and Technology Indicators this year, a French academic researching soil in Africa reported that only 5% of the published work in his field has originated from African researchers.', 'When he dug deeper into his own research, he found that 50% of what he had learned about African soil came from African researchers, who have not or could not publish their work in international academic journals.', 'Countries where English is not the lingua franca are particularly disadvantaged in science, not because they lack academic excellence, but because English-language journals call the shots.', 'Non-English academic journals simply do not command the same attention in the science community.', 'As a result, the scope of research topics that many countries can undertake is limited, and they must struggle to retain scientific talent.', 'This is particularly true in the Middle East, where governments are struggling to diversify their economies, in order to make them more resilient.', 'As English-language empirical-research journals consolidate their hold on the channels that determine whether or not a scientist will have a successful career, developing countries will have to invest heavily in their own data infrastructure to place domestic researchers on a more competitive footing.', 'But even ‚Äì or especially ‚Äì if developing countries do make such investments, much will be lost to science.', 'With (mostly) United States-based academic journals reigning over global science, no one has to move to become part of a new brain drain, whereby scientists‚Äô research priorities, problems, and methods gravitate to the

potential client bases in the world.', 'In other words, financial-service providers have every reason to cater to people with disabilities.', 'Why, then, are most businesses doing just the opposite?', 'One reason is a lack of awareness.', 'Because people with disabilities typically have less income than their nondisabled peers, service providers have often lacked an incentive to extend support to them.', 'But, with more attention being paid to total market potential, financial institutions are starting to adjust their product lines accordingly.', 'As they do, four issues must be addressed to maximize the benefits for customers with accessibility challenges.', 'First, financial-services companies must work harder to understand the needs of current and future clients.', 'For example, with better data, a bank in a particular market could improve the accessibility of its mobile-banking platforms.', 'This is essentially what happened at Standard Chartered Bank in India last year, when employees developed a voice-assisted system to help visually impaired customers access their accounts online.', 'Good data are also essential to the effectiveness of advocacy groups as they push providers to improve their services.', 'Second, engagement must not stop with innovative products; it must also be extended to the labor market.', 'Simply put, the financial-services industry should hire more people with disabilities by investing in assistive technologies like braille readers and alternative and augmentative communication devices.', 'The need to diversify the workforce is particularly acute in the United States, where one in five people has a disability.', 'Third, people with disabilities must always be included in discussions about how to expand and strengthen financial independence.', 'In 2013, when the Lloyds Banking Group convened a focus group to examine the effects of dementia on customer behavior, engagement with clients led to the charter on Dementia-friendly Financial Services.', 'This innovative document codified how banks should tailor products to clients with cognitive impairments.', 'Future initiatives should follow this collaborative model to ensure that decision-making at all levels is facilitated by human-centered design.', 'And, lastly, governments must commit to addressing this issue, by emulating the action of countries like the UK, which has linked services for the disabled to development funding.', 'With the right support, progress on these complex challenges can be sweeping; for example, at Financial Sector Deepening Uganda, where I work, we are using British aid money to extend financial services to the disabled in rural communities.', 'Our vision is to encourage the emergence of similar programs in many other countries around the world.', 'With 91 countries having already ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, it is clear that there is plenty of political support for these initiatives.', 'The challenge now is to turn pledges into action.', 'In the coming decades, the world‚Äôs disabled population will grow as medical advances allow people to live longer, healthier, fuller lives.', 'Providing the disabled with access to financial services and products is among the best ways to guard against discrimination and nurture long-term empowerment.', 'Full financial inclusion will come slowly for a community often referred to as the ‚Äúfastest-growing minority group in the world.‚Äù', 'The task for activists, advocates, enlightened business leaders, and policymakers is to highlight the social and economic benefits of success.', '', 'Surgery for All', 'BOSTON ‚Äì On a recent trip to India, I hailed a rickshaw that was pedaled, I soon noticed, by a man with a lame leg.', 'It turns out that a few weeks earlier, the driver had been hit by a car while navigating the busy streets of New Delhi.', 'Although he had managed to obtain medication from a local pharmacy for the agonizing pain ‚Äì probably because his leg was broken ‚Äì he could spare neither the time nor the money to see a surgeon.', 'This type of tragic calculus is strikingly common.', 'The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery estimates that some five billion people ‚Äì almost 70% of the world‚Äôs population ‚Äì lack access to safe, affordable surgical and anesthetic care, while 33 million people are saddled with unbearably high health expenses.', 'Not surprisingly, the global poor suffer disproportionately: while low-income countries are home to close to 35% of humanity, they account for just 3.5% of all surgical procedures.', 'One of the biggest obstacles to achieving universal health coverage ‚Äì which the United Nations has declared a global goal ‚Äì is financing.', 'And, paradoxical as it may sound, one of the best ways that governments can get the money they need to expand coverage is by making surgery more widely available.', 'Time-sensitive health problems ‚Äì such as injuries from traffic accidents and pregnancy-related complications ‚Äì are among the leading causes of death and disability in low- and middle-income countries.', 'But untreated or undertreated conditions requiring surgery also hurt economic productivity.', 'For example, the Lancet study estimated that the failure to improve surgical care in developing countries would translate into $12.3 trillion of lost economic output by 2030.', 'Failure to maintain strong surgical capacity could even undercut economic gains made by middle-income countries, reducing total GDP growth by approximately 2% annually.', 'For many leaders, the common perception is that provision of surgical care is not sustainable or cost-effective.', 'When faced with tough budget choices, governments often favor programs that combat infectious and chronic diseases, leaving people like my rickshaw driver in the lurch.', 'But a growing body of evidence suggests that these views are misplaced.', 'When researchers at the Harvard Medical School analyzed surgical interventions in low- and middle-income countries, they found a remarkable disconnect between economic assumptions and reality.', 'For example, they calculated that money spent on cesarean sections and joint surgeries yields higher returns than spending on the management of HIV or heart disease.', 'To be sure, chronic and infectious diseases need our attention, too; we cannot restructure health systems overnight, nor should we turn our backs on those being treated for non-surgical illnesses.', 'But reforms that focus more attention on the importance of surgery would boost economic productivity and help create more equitable health care for everyone.', 'For starters, health ministries and physician organizations should formally recognize that surgical and anesthetic care are an essential part of universal health coverage.', 'To make this case, health-care providers will need to improve their collection and analysis of data on surgical outcomes, which would increase transparency on mortality and morbidity and strengthen overall accountability.', 'Decisions about how to expand services could be guided by the Lancet commission‚Äôs core indicators on ‚Äúpreparedness,‚Äù ‚Äúdelivery,‚Äù and ‚Äúimpact‚Äù of surgical care.', 'Second, to pool risk and guard against cost overruns, countries that are considering universal coverage policies should put surgical care under publicly financed plans.', 'While some funding for expanding surgical services could come from taxation, health-care providers should also explore innovative financing options ‚Äì such as ‚Äúsocial justice models,‚Äù whereby people pay according to their means.', 'Finally, to streamline resources and increase surgical capacity, hospitals should explore task-sharing, whereby non-emergency cases are referred to licensed nurses and physician assistants.', 'Longer-term strategies include investing more in medical education to bolster the ranks of doctors and surgeons.', 'The tremendous economic progress that many developing countries have made in recent decades has been largely driven by vibrant, young, and ambitious populations.', 'One of the most effective ways to maintain this growth and development is to ensure access to safe and affordable healthcare ‚Äì including surgery.', 'While the cost of providing it may be high, the cost of not providing it is even higher.', '', 'Polluters Must Pay', 'NEW YORK ‚Äì When BP and its drilling partners caused the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the United States government demanded that BP finance the cleanup, compensate those who suffered damages, and pay criminal penalties for the violations that led to the disaster.', 'BP has already committed more than $20 billion in remediation and penalties.', 'Based on a settlement last week, BP will now pay the largest criminal penalty in US history ‚Äì $4.5 billion.', 'The same standards for environmental cleanup need to be applied to global companies operating in poorer countries, where their power has typically been so great relative to that of governments that many act with impunity, wreaking havoc on the environment with little or no accountability.', 'As we enter a new era of sustainable development, impunity must turn to responsibility.', 'Polluters must pay, whether in rich or poor countries.', 'Major companies need to accept responsibility for their actions.', 'Nigeria has been Exhibit A of corporate environmental impunity.', 'For decades, major oil companies, including Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron, have been producing oil in the Niger Delta, an ecologically fragile environment of freshwater swamp forests, mangroves, lowland rainforests, and coastal barrier islands.', 'This rich habitat supports remarkable biodiversity ‚Äì or did before the oil companies got there ‚Äì and more than 30 million local inhabitants, who depend on the local ecosystems for their health and livelihoods.', 'Twenty years ago, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classified the Niger Delta as a region of high biodiversity of marine and coastal flora and fauna ‚Äì tree species, fish, birds, and mammals, among other forms of life ‚Äì and therefore rated it as a very high priority for conservation.', 'Yet it also noted that the region‚Äôs biodiversity was under massive threat, with little or no protection.', 'The global companies operating in the delta have spilled oil and flared natural gas for decades, without regard for the natural environment and the communities impoverished and poisoned by their actions.', 'One estimate puts the cumulative spills over the past 50 years at approximately 10 million barrels ‚Äì twice the size of the BP spill.', 'The data are uncertain: there have been many thousands of spills during this period ‚Äì often poorly documented and their magnitude hidden or simply unmeasured by either the companies or the government.', 'Indeed, just as BP was being hit with new criminal penalties, ExxonMobil announced yet another pipeline leak in the Niger Delta.', 'The environmental destruction of the delta is part of a larger saga: corrupt companies operating hand in hand with corrupt government officials.', 'The companies routinely bribe officials to gain oil leases, lie about output, evade taxes, and dodge responsibility for the environmental damage that they cause.', 'Nigerian officials have become fabulously wealthy, owing to decades of payoffs by international companies that have plundered the delta‚Äôs natural wealth.', 'Shell, the largest foreign operator in the Niger Delta, has been criticized repeatedly for its egregious practices and its unwillingness to be held to account.', 'Meanwhile, the local population has remained impoverished and beset by diseases caused by unsafe air, poisoned drinking water, and pollution in the food chain.', 'Local lawlessness has led to gang warfare and persistent illegal tapping into the pipelines to steal oil, leading to further massive oil spills and frequent explosions that kill dozens, including innocent bystanders.', 'In the colonial era, it was the official purpose of imperial power to extract wealth from the administered territories.', 'In the post-colonial period, the methods are better disguised.', 'When oil companies misbehave in Nigeria or elsewhere, they are protected by the power of their home countries.', 'Don‚Äôt mess with the companies, they are told by the United States and Europe.', 'Indeed, one of the largest bribes (a reputed $180 million) paid in recent times in Nigeria was by Halliburton, a company tightly intertwined with US political power.', '(Dick Cheney went from being Halliburton‚Äôs CEO to the US vice presidency.)', 'Last year, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) issued a remarkable report on Ogoniland, a major ethnic homeland in the Niger Delta that has been at the epicenter of conflict between local communities and international oil.', 'The report was as scathing as it was scientifically clear.', 'Despite many past promises of a cleanup, Ogoniland remains in environmental agony, impoverished and sickened by the oil industry.', 'UNEP also offered clear and detailed recommendations, including emergency measures to ensure safe drinking water; cleanup activities targeting the mangroves and soils; public-health studies to identify and counteract the consequences of pollution; and a new regulatory framework.', 'The world‚Äôs governments have recently agreed to move to a new framework for sustainable development, declaring their intention to adopt Sustainable Development Goals at the Rio+20 Summit in June.', 'The SDGs offer a critical opportunity for the world to set clear, compelling standards for government and corporate behavior.', 'Many major companies, including in the oil industry, have expressed their readiness to support sustainable development goals.', 'Cleaning up the Niger Delta would provide the strongest possible example of a new age of accountability.', 'Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and other major oil companies should step forward and help to fund the necessary cleanup, ushering in a new era of responsibility.', 'The Nigerian government‚Äôs own accountability is on the line as well.', 'It is heartening that several Nigerian senators have recently been in the forefront of efforts to strengthen the rule of law in the oil sector.', 'The cleanup of the Niger Delta provides an ideal opportunity for Nigeria, the oil industry, and the international community to show convincingly that a new age has dawned.', 'From now on, sustainable development must not be a mere slogan, but rather an operational approach to global governance and well-being on a strained and crowded planet.', '', 'Remembering Sri Lanka‚Äôs Killing Fields', 'NEW YORK ‚Äì One of the worst atrocity crime stories of recent decades has barely registered in the world‚Äôs collective conscience.', 'We remember and acknowledge the shame of Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Darfur.', 'We agonize about the failure to halt the atrocities being committed almost daily in Syria.', 'But, at least until now, the world has paid almost no attention to war crimes and crimes against humanity comparable in their savagery to any of these: the killing fields of Sri Lanka in 2009.', 'Three years ago, in the bloody endgame of the Sri Lankan government‚Äôs war against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, some 300,000 civilians became trapped between the advancing army and the last LTTE fighters in what has been called ‚Äúthe cage‚Äù ‚Äì a tiny strip of land, not much larger than New York City‚Äôs Central Park, between sea and lagoon in the northeast of the country.', 'With both sides showing neither restraint nor compassion, at least 10,000 civilians ‚Äì possibly as many as 40,000 ‚Äì died in the carnage that followed, as a result of indiscriminate army shelling, rebel gunfire, and denial of food and medical supplies.', 'The lack of outrage mainly reflects the Sri Lankan government‚Äôs success in embedding in the minds of policymakers and publics an alternative narrative that had extraordinary worldwide resonance in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.', 'What occurred in the cage, according to this narrative, was the long-overdue defeat, by wholly necessary and defensible means, of a murderous terrorist insurrection that had threatened the country‚Äôs very existence.', 'The other key reason behind the world‚Äôs silence is that the Sri Lankan government was relentless in banning independent observers ‚Äì media, NGOs, or diplomats ‚Äì from witnessing or reporting on its actions.', 'And this problem was compounded by the timidity of in-country United Nations officials in communicating such information as they had.', 'President Mahinda Rajapaksa‚Äôs government claimed throughout, and still does, that it maintained a ‚Äúzero civilian casualties‚Äù policy.', 'Officials argued that no heavy artillery fire was ever directed at civilians or hospitals, that any collateral injury to civilians was minimal, and that they fully respected international law, including the proscription against execution of captured prisoners.', 'But that narrative is now being picked apart in a series of recent publications, notably the report last year of a UN Panel of Experts, and in two new books: UN official Gordon Weiss‚Äôs relentlessly analytical The Cage: The Fight for Sri Lanka and the Last Days of the Tamil Tigers, and BBC journalist Frances Harrison‚Äôs harrowingly anecdotal Still Counting the Dead: Survivors of Sri Lanka‚Äôs Hidden War.', 'Nobody underplays the LTTE‚Äôs contribution to the 2009 savagery; but, with the Tigers‚Äô leaders all dead, international attention should now be focused overwhelmingly on holding the government accountable for its failure to accept its responsibility to protect its own people.', 'For far too long, Rajapaska‚Äôs government has been evading accountability with an endless stream of diversionary maneuvers (usually involving committees of inquiry intended to lead nowhere, and duly complying), denial of physical access, outright dissimulation, and relentless verbal intimidation of anyone daring to question it.', 'Real international pressure is at last being placed on the government to explain its actions, most significantly by the much-maligned UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, which will consider Sri Lanka‚Äôs response in March 2013.', 'In doing so, it is likely to be armed with a full brief of evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity now being compiled from eyewitness accounts by the Australian-based International Crimes Evidence Project.', 'One of the most tragic aspects of the whole story, just now emerging, is the failure of UN officials on the ground to publicize at the time, when it really mattered, credible information that would have undercut the government‚Äôs narrative.', 'Specific estimates of casualties in the combat area were compiled by a UN team in Colombo from early 2009, based on regular radiophone contact with a handful of reliable sources ‚Äì NGO, medical, and local UN Tamil staff ‚Äì still on the ground.', 'The information was incomplete, but it was solid ‚Äì and alarming.', 'But an institutional decision was taken not to use this information on the grounds that it could not be ‚Äúverified.‚Äù', 'The real reasons are now emerging.', 'In part, the UN team wanted to keep humanitarian assistance lines open.', 'The team was also subjected to shameless verbal bullying by Sri Lankan officials (a deeply unpleasant experience to which I, too, have been subjected).', 'The team‚Äôs members also knew that Sri Lanka‚Äôs government had wide support among UN member states, and that the LTTE had none at all.', 'But, as the Lakhdar Brahimi Panel concluded a decade ago, after reviewing some of the catastrophic failures of peace processes in the 1990‚Äôs, the responsibility of the UN Secretariat must be to tell the UN Security Council what it needs to hear, not what it wants to hear.', 'An internal review panel studying what went wrong in the UN system‚Äôs response to Sri Lanka, commissioned by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and headed by the distinguished diplomat Charles Petrie, is due to report to Ban next month.', 'All indications are that it will not be a pretty story.', 'It is crucial that its findings be made public and acted upon.', 'Selective memory is a defense mechanism with which we are all familiar.', 'For governments and international organizations, as with individuals, moral failure is easier to live with if we can pretend that it never happened.', 'But mass atrocity crimes did happen in Sri Lanka, there was moral default all around, and if we do not learn from this past, we will indeed be condemned to repeat it.', '', 'Saving Capitalism from Economics 101', 'WASHINGTON, DC ‚Äì All across the United States, students are settling into college ‚Äì and coming to grips with ‚ÄúEcon 101.‚Äù', 'This introductory course is typically taught with a broadly reassuring message: if markets are allowed to work, good outcomes ‚Äì such as productivity growth, increasing wages, and generally shared prosperity ‚Äì will surely follow.', 'Unfortunately, as my co-author James Kwak points out in his recent book, Economism: Bad Economics and the Rise of Inequality, Econ 101 is so far from being the whole story that it could actually be considered misleading ‚Äì at least as a guide to sensible policymaking.', 'Markets can be good, but they are also profoundly susceptible to abusive practices, including by prominent private-sector people.', 'This is not a theoretical concern; it is central to our current policy debates, including important new US legislation that has just been put forward.', 'One core problem is that market incentives reward self-interested private behavior, without accounting for social benefits or costs.', 'We generally overlook our actions‚Äô spillover effects on others, or ‚Äúexternalities.‚Äù', 'To be fair, Econ 101 textbooks do discuss this issue in some contexts, such as pollution, and it is widely accepted that environmental damage needs to be regulated if we are to have clean air, clean water, and limits on other pollutants.', 'Unfortunately, ‚Äúwidely accepted‚Äù does not include by President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration, which is busy rolling back environmental protections across a broad range of activities.', 'The New York Times counts 76 rollbacks in progress.', 'The thinking behind this policy is straight out of the first few weeks of Econ 101: get out of the way of the market.', 'As a result, there is a lot more pollution ‚Äì including more emission of greenhouse gases ‚Äì in America‚Äôs future.', 'There is also an even deeper problem.', 'There is a general presumption in Econ 101 that firms should maximize profits, and that this is best for their shareholders and for society.', 'But this notion of ‚Äúfirms‚Äù is just a shorthand for people organized in a particular form.', 'People, not firms, make decisions.', 'To understand the nature and impact of these decisions, we need to look closely at the incentives of firms‚Äô senior managers and board members.', 'Since the 1970s, the people who run firms have become much more focused on increasing their compensation, through bonuses, stock options, and the like.', 'There has been a significant rise in the value of shares, most of which are owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans.', 'At the same time, median wages have barely increased ‚Äì a dramatic change from the immediate post-World War II period, when productivity increases led to steady wage gains.', 'Today, it is top managers and members of boards of directors in whose interest firms are run.', 'Investors sometimes get a good ride, though there are plenty of instances where insiders take excessive advantage by awarding themselves overly generous compensation, taking on excessive risk, or engaging in other, more devious practices.', 'The idea that compensation committees insist on genuinely impressive performance, relative to relevant benchmarks, has become risible.', 'This is the context in which Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is proposing a new Accountable Capitalism Act.', 'Very large companies would need to acquire a federal charter (as opposed to the current state charter arrangements), which would come with specific obligations ‚Äì in particular, the need to consider the interests of all corporate stakeholders, including workers.', 'To make this more meaningful and generally improve transparency, ordinary (non-management) employees should get some representation on the board of directors.', 'This type of arrangement works well in Germany, a country where workers continue to be treated with respect.', 'Warren also supports a proposal that originated from John Bogle, founder of Vanguard (a mutual fund company), that would require super-majority support from shareholders and directors before a large company could engage in political expenditures.', 'The underlying legal theory behind these proposals is sound, and it is well articulated in a letter signed by Robert Hockett of Cornell Law School and other distinguished figures.', 'Large corporations are granted significant rights, including limited liability for individual executives, and facilitate the pooling of large amounts of capital from people who do not necessarily know one another (or the promoters of the company).', 'Originally, the purpose was to enable the private sector to carry out large-scale risky investments that had broader potential impact, such as building canals and railroads.', 'The US supposedly constrains the activities of large corporations, with the Department of Justice taking action if companies acquire monopoly power or otherwise behave in an anti-competitive manner.', 'Realistically, the enforcement of antitrust law has slipped a long way in recent years, under both Republican and Democratic administrations.', 'Warren is proposing a much broader rethink.', 'Large corporations can still do well, but they need to be held accountable in a much more transparent way.', 'Incentives for executives would be adjusted, and running these companies would no longer be so much about lining their own pockets.', 'Workers would no longer be treated so badly, and more people might even start to believe again in the American Dream of prosperity for all.', 'The legitimacy of capitalism ‚Äì private ownership and reliance on market mechanisms ‚Äì would be greatly strengthened under the Accountable Capitalism Act.', 'So, yes, like it or not, this will be on the final exam.', '', 'Accounting for Gaza', 'New York ‚Äì This week the United Nations Human Rights Council will debate the report of the fact-finding mission led by Judge Richard Goldstone on human rights violations in the Gaza conflict.', 'Let us hope it is a full and fair examination based on the report‚Äôs findings and recommendations.', 'Goldstone and his team concluded that both Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian group controlling Gaza, committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity during the period of the conflict which the investigation addressed.', 'The report calls for credible investigations of alleged rights violations and recommends that the UN Security Council require both sides to report back within six months on the results, including any prosecutions they will carry out in connection with the violations identified.', 'Failure to do so, in the view of Goldstone‚Äôs commission, should result in the Security Council referring the matter to the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court in The Hague.', 'Unfortunately, rather than debating Goldstone‚Äôs detailed findings and the merits of his recommendations on ways to move forward, there are indications that governments may focus instead on the process leading up to the investigation and seek to limit full discussion of the report.', 'As someone involved in that process, I feel it is important to put my views on record, as comments I made previously are now being used as part of the effort to undermine Judge Goldstone and his important work.', 'I refused to accept the invitation from the president of the Human Rights Council at the time, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi of Nigeria, to lead the investigation following the Human Rights Council‚Äôs January 12, 2009 resolution.', 'As a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, I felt strongly that the Council‚Äôs resolution was one-sided and did not permit a balanced approach to determining the situation on the ground.', 'It referred only to ‚Äúthe grave violations of human

and international humanitarian law by the occupying power, Israel, against the Palestinian people.‚Äù', 'I was also aware that the UN Human Rights Council had made repeated condemnations of Israel over the past two years but had focused little attention on large-scale violations of human rights in other countries.', 'This pattern of action and inaction by the Council has given greater credence to those who believe the UN‚Äôs highest human rights body is inherently anti-Israel.', 'I decided I could not undertake the mission for these reasons.', 'I am aware that Judge Goldstone, a dedicated and unimpeachable human rights lawyer and advocate, shared similar concerns when he was initially approached.', 'But he was able to work with the Council‚Äôs president to secure an agreement he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as to allow his team to address the actions taken by both parties to the conflict.', 'Experts can debate whether this was in conformity with UN rules and procedures.', 'I have no doubt that those involved were seeking a way forward that would allow for a full investigation and help overcome the political divisiveness currently undermining the Human Rights Council within the UN system.', 'The question now is whether governments will give Judge Goldstone‚Äôs findings the serious attention they deserve, or instead fall back into an overtly political posture.', \"As Goldstone's report makes clear:\", 'Both the Palestinians and the Israelis are legitimately angered at the lives that they are forced to lead: For the Palestinians, the anger about individual events ‚Äì the civilian casualties, injuries and destruction in Gaza following from military attacks, the blockade, the continued construction of the Wall outside of the 1967 borders ‚Äì feed into an underlying anger about the continuing Israeli occupation, its daily humiliations and their as-yet-unfulfilled right to self-determination.', 'For the Israelis, the public statements of Palestinian armed groups celebrating rocket and mortar attacks on civilians strengthen a deep-rooted concern that negotiation will yield little and that their nation remains under existential threat from which only it can protect its people.', 'In this way, both the Israelis and the Palestinians share a secret fear ‚Äì for some, a belief ‚Äì that each has no intention of accepting the other‚Äôs right to a country of their own.', 'This anger and fear are unfortunately ably represented by many politicians.', '(Para.', '1705)', 'For the sake of human rights

laureate Joseph Stiglitz.\", 'The Arthur Anderson and Enron scandals in America have focused attention on the problems of accounting in private businesses.', 'But the scale of this corruption should not blind us to the problem of public sector accounting, where many deceitful things are also being done.', 'Accounting rules are designed to provide standardized frameworks within which the financial position of a firm, or government, can be assessed.', 'Bad accounting frameworks always lead to bad information, and bad information leads to bad decisions, with serious long term consequences.', 'This is true in the public as well as the private sector.', \"America's business scandals showed how accounting rules can be bent and abused to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a company.\", 'The Bush Administration, not to be left behind, has shown how public accounting rules can be bent so as to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a

rely on foreign aid because aid is too unstable.\", 'The truth, of course, is that aid is more stable than tax revenues in poor countries.', \"By the IMF's logic, neither aid nor tax revenues should be included in budgets.\", 'If that is the case, every country in the world is in deep trouble.', 'The absurdity here is the idea that all foreign aid should be added to reserves.', \"But donor

developing countries have the correct answer to the problem of revenue instability: expenditure flexibility.', \"Build schools when you have aid; stop building them when you don't.\", 'For years, World Bank economists have tried to convince the IMF to see this logic, with little progress.', 'Other IMF accounting practices, including how the capital expenditures of government-owned enterprises are treated, are also causing outrage.', 'If a state owned enterprise in Latin America wants to borrow to make an investment, in Latin America such borrowing is treated as an addition to the deficit.', 'Investors, worried about the size of a government deficit, see only the bottom line.', 'But if a company can buy a $1 billion asset for $500 million, economic logic says buy the asset.', 'The balance sheet is improved by $500 million.', 'But by IMF logic, all you see in the accounts is increased expenditure and borrowing, not the value of the acquired asset.', \"Because of this rule, investors may only see an apparent worsening of the country's fiscal position, and so may demand higher interest rates.\", 'Of course, foreign investors like this IMF logic: government corporations are put at a distinct disadvantage: their ability to invest inhibited, these firms cannot compete to make acquisitions.', 'A second IMF accounting distortion involves stabilization funds.', 'These are national funds that, in boom years, receive revenues from sales of natural resources to be set aside against a rainy day.', 'This makes sense.', 'But IMF accounting inhibits the use of these funds to help stabilize an economy through counter-cyclical fiscal spending.', 'According to Mexican and Chilean officials I have discussed the matter with, spending from a stabilization fund is reportedly treated as if the country is borrowing, thus adding to its deficit.', 'It is, of course, in times of economic downturn that countries worry most about their credit rating, so the IMF stance is particularly unhelpful.', \"IMF accounting frameworks, rather than providing useful signals to the market, provide distorted information that exacerbates a troubled country's problems.\", 'Good decisions require accurate information, and this comes only through good accounting frameworks.', 'Of course, no perfect accounting framework exists, but some frameworks systematically distort.', 'Indeed, a hidden agenda often exists in the choice of an accounting framework.', 'Not including stock options inside the accounting framework served US corporate interests, and those of individual

surprisingly, workers are leaving the eurozone‚Äôs crisis countries, but not necessarily for its stronger northern region.', 'Instead, Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau.', 'Irish workers are leaving in droves to Canada, Australia, and the United States.', 'Spanish workers are streaming into Romania, which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in Spain.', 'Still, if intra-eurozone mobility were anything like Mundell‚Äôs ideal, today we would not be seeing 25% unemployment in Spain while Germany‚Äôs unemployment rate is below 7%.', 'Later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union, which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration.', 'Peter Kenen argued in the late 1960‚Äôs that without exchange-rate movements as a shock absorber, a currency union requires fiscal transfers as a way to share risk.', 'For a normal country, the national income-tax system constitutes a huge automatic stabilizer across regions.', 'In the US, when oil prices go up, incomes in Texas and Montana rise, which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget, thereby helping out the rest of the country.', 'Europe, of course, has no significant centralized tax authority, so this key automatic stabilizer is essentially absent.', 'Some European academics tried to argue that there was no need for US-like fiscal transfers, because any desired degree of risk sharing can, in theory, be achieved through financial markets.', 'This claim was hugely misguided.', 'Financial markets can be fragile, and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income, which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy.', 'Kenen was mainly concerned with short-term transfers to smooth out cyclical bumpiness.', 'But, in a currency union with huge differences in income and development levels, the short term can stretch out for a very long time.', 'Many Germans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will morph into a permanent feeding tube, much the way that northern Italy has been propping up southern Italy for the last century.', 'Indeed, more than 20 years on, Western Germans still see no end in sight for the bills from German unification.', 'Later, Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that, in addition to fiscal transfers, a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort.', 'Otherwise, bank runs and debt panics will be rampant.', 'Obstfeld had in mind a bailout mechanism for banks, but it is now abundantly clear that one also needs a lender of last resort and a bankruptcy mechanism for states and municipalities.', 'A logical corollary of the criteria set forth by Kenen and Obstfeld, and even of Mundell‚Äôs labor-mobility criterion, is that currency unions cannot survive without political legitimacy, most likely involving region-wide popular elections.', 'Europe‚Äôs leaders cannot carry out large transfers across countries indefinitely without a coherent European political framework.', 'European policymakers today often complain that, were it not for the US financial crisis, the eurozone would be doing just fine.', 'Perhaps they are right.', 'But any financial system must be able to withstand shocks, including big ones.', 'Europe may never be an ‚Äúoptimum‚Äù currency area by any standard.', 'But, without further profound political and economic integration ‚Äì which may not end up including all current

not, the world around us is in a state of constant change.', 'But recent economic trends suggest that this change may be shifting its direction in a fundamental way.', 'Consider the advanced economies.', 'During the last two decades, economic growth in these countries was led by consumption ‚Äì so much so that economic activity in these economies swung from investment to consumption by a total of 10 percentage points of GDP.', 'As a result, in 2010 the share of consumption in their GDP had reached 81.6%.', '1990', '2010', '(In percent of GDP)', 'Advanced economies', 'Consumption', '76.4', '81.6', 'Investment', '23.7', '18.4', 'Emerging and developing economies', 'Consumption', '73.4', '67.1', 'Investment', '26.0', '30.8', 'Meanwhile, emerging markets and developing economies provided almost a mirror image of this trend, raising their investment and boosting the supply of goods to the rest of the world at the cost of consumption in their own economies.', 'By 2010, the share of consumption in their GDP had declined, from 73.4% to 67.1%.', 'Looking forward, it is unlikely that the consumption share of GDP can increase further in advanced economies.', 'The main drivers of this increase were primarily financial engineering and wealth effects from strong asset prices.', 'Neither of these factors currently is at play to push consumption‚Äôs share of GDP higher.', 'But can the advanced economies‚Äô consumption even be sustained at the current level?', 'Perhaps not.', 'Current levels of consumption are associated with over-extended governments and households, whose debt levels remain high, implying that more savings are required.', 'Banks also need to raise capital.', 'In general, many economic agents need an extended period of deleveraging.', 'However, current policies in the major advanced economies are aimed at maintaining current consumption levels in order to support growth and employment.', 'If the consumption share of GDP nonetheless declines, simple arithmetic tells us that investment and exports need to be higher to maintain total demand.', 'Should we expect emerging markets and developing economies to pick up the slack?', 'To sustain strong growth in these economies as external demand weakens, domestic demand needs to become the major engine of growth.', 'This means stronger domestic consumption and appropriate levels of investment to support such consumption growth.', 'In economies where investment levels are leading to excess capacity, resources could shift from investment to consumption, provided that these countries‚Äô external accounts remain sustainable.', 'These are major tectonic shifts in the structure of the global economy, and are fraught with potential dangers.', 'The pace of change will vary between sectors and across economies, leading to mismatches of demand and supply worldwide.', 'Moreover, with globalization, an economic problem in one part of the world can be transmitted to the rest of the world more strongly, substantially complicating policy responses in both advanced and developing economies.', 'A study of such spillover effects by the International Monetary Fund suggests that, before the global financial crisis, external factors explained 36% of change in output in the five systemically important economies (the eurozone, the United States, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom); after the crisis, however, this share reached close to 60%.', 'In the rest of the world, including emerging markets, the share of external factors in output change increased from about 43% to more than 60%.', 'In this environment, we must diligently pursue policy coordination at the global level.', 'To achieve an orderly realignment of consumption and investment worldwide, policies that boost investment in one part of the world should match policies that boost consumption in other parts.', 'In particular, advanced economies should implement fundamental productivity-enhancing reforms, the eurozone should strengthen the currency union, and emerging market and developing economies should boost their domestic sources of growth.', 'And these policies should be consistent with fiscal and external stability.', 'Moreover, financial-sector policies and regulatory frameworks should be coordinated at the global level, in order to design and implement consensus-based rules ‚Äì thereby addressing the problems posed by very large, global institutions that are considered too big or too complex to fail.', 'Only with such global coordination can we reduce, and possibly eliminate, economic instability and disorderly adjustments both at home and abroad, even as we seek to maximize the benefits of the inevitable changes in the global economy.', '', 'Achieving a ‚ÄúEurope of Results‚Äù', 'BRUSSELS ‚Äì The tsunami that has swept across financial markets is a global catastrophe.', 'If handled correctly, however, the crisis may yet raise the esteem of the European Union and its institutions.', 'The EU‚Äôs legitimacy problem has two different aspects: apathy, leading to a low turnout in the European parliamentary elections, and outright euro-skepticism.', 'The voter-turnout problem partly reflects frustration about the present state of the EU, and also people‚Äôs impression that they can exert little influence by voting one way or the other.', 'Euro-skepticism, on the other hand, and the looming threat of anti-European populism, is directly linked to the idea that the EU is not merely incapable of offering a solution to the crisis, but in fact is part of the problem.', 'So, although the EU represents our best hope of ensuring that Europe is internationally competitive in today‚Äôs increasingly difficult environment, it is actually being blamed for globalization.', 'Many people confuse these two aspects of the EU‚Äôs legitimacy problem, and believe that somehow turnout in European elections can be increased by pointing out to people how good and important the EU is.', 'But in most cases, this is not possible.', 'At first sight, the easiest answer to the problem of low voter turnout is to give more power to the European Parliament.', 'But if this was the solution, then we would not have had steadily declining turnouts since the high point of 63%, at the first elections to the European Parliament in 1979.', 'After all, since then the EP‚Äôs influence and powers of joint decision-making have grown constantly.', 'The trouble is that, EP elections must be ‚Äúabout‚Äù something if voters are to be interested, which means they must involve a real choice.', 'And a real choice requires Europe-wide election campaigns by all parties.', 'This would also involve making the choice of the European Commission‚Äôs president dependent on the outcome of the EP elections.', 'But, in fact, both of these conditions have already been met; in 2004, Portuguese Prime Minister Jos√© Manuel Dur√£o Barroso was appointed President of the Commission because he came from the political organization with the strongest election result, the European People‚Äôs Party.', 'And this year‚Äôs elections saw a more intensive presence of party organizations at European level than ever before.', 'Instead, I believe that the most important way to reawaken voters‚Äô interest in European elections will be to open up the election of the Commission‚Äôs President to them, and create a genuinely Europe-wide political debate during the next election campaign.', 'The Euro-skepticism problem can be tackled only if the Union itself starts to perform better, and is seen to be doing so.', 'That is why in the aftermath of the failed referenda four years ago in France and the Netherlands on the Constitutional treaty, the Commission tried to emphasize the idea of a ‚ÄúEurope of Results‚Äù that would seek to convince citizens of its worth through concrete achievements.', 'Given the gravity of the economic crisis, the time has come for the EU to demonstrate its strengths whenever possible.', 'The aim must be not only to win back the hearts of Europeans who have become skeptical, but also to convince them that the Union is indispensable to meeting the challenges Europeans face.', 'Europe‚Äôs citizens understand that the relatively small nation-states that make up the EU are no longer able to face these enormous challenges on their own.', 'In Ireland, last autumn‚Äôs financial crisis provoked a turnaround in public opinion about the EU, and even in Iceland, although it lies on the periphery of our continent, membership of the EU and the euro have become a priority.', 'European countries have become so interconnected that isolated national measures on issues like financial-market regulation are hopeless.', 'A changing world in which new powers like China and India play an increasingly important role will not wait for Europe to make up its mind.', 'The EU must instead show leadership through its efforts to solve the world‚Äôs current problems.', 'As for the European People‚Äôs Party, for us the economy is not an end in itself but should serve the people.', 'The economic crisis was caused by shortsightedness and a lack of control in the global financial system.', 'Now we must redefine the role of regulators in financial markets and in the wider economy, for we cannot let the financial sector walk off with the profits and leave taxpayers bearing the losses.', 'That doesn‚Äôt mean that we are advocating a move to socialism; we want better and smarter regulation, not regulation for its own sake.', 'We see five keys to recovery:', 'A ‚ÄúEurope of Results‚Äù is achievable.', 'It can strengthen the EU‚Äôs legitimacy, though, only if policy recommendations such as these, and the successes that result from implementing them, are communicated clearly and effectively to the general public.', '', 'Achieving a US-China Strategic Understanding', 'ALBERTA ‚Äì Relations between the United States and China have been at a low point in recent months.', 'Tensions over US arms sales to Taiwan, President Barack Obama‚Äôs meeting with the Dalai Lama, disputes over the value of China‚Äôs currency, a supposed snub of Obama by Chinese leaders at December‚Äôs Copenhagen climate summit, and the rupture between Google and China have all played a role.', 'But President Hu Jintao‚Äôs visit to Washington for the nuclear security summit, which followed a phone conversation between him and Obama, has set the stage for a serious and calm exchange of views on a range of bilateral and international issues, including Iran‚Äôs nuclear program.', 'This calming of the diplomatic atmosphere was helped considerably by US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner delaying his', 'report to Congress on whether or not China is a currency manipulator.', 'Geithner even made a quick stop in Beijing on April 8 to meet Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan, prompting reports that China may let the renminbi float more flexibly.', 'Nevertheless, before anyone concludes that US-China ties are warming up, it is worth noting that the two countries have starkly different views on how to manage their relationship.', 'Take the recent Obama-Hu telephone conversation.', 'Reports in the US following the hour-long exchange praised it as a turning point in bilateral relations, and headlines emphasized that Obama worked on Hu to achieve a common stand in sanctioning Iran over its pursuit of nuclear weapons.', 'Yet Chinese news releases gave no indication of such a ‚Äúbreakthrough.‚Äù', 'Instead, they stressed Hu‚Äôs demand that the US side ‚Äúproperly handle‚Äù the Taiwan and Tibet issues, which represent China‚Äôs ‚Äúcore interests.‚Äù', 'There was not even a mention that the two leaders discussed Iran, other than one line saying that they exchanged views on international issues of common concern.', 'Such discrepancies reflect a broader perception gap.', 'On the American side, the emerging consensus is that the Obama administration began its term committed to working closely with China on a range of issues.', 'It took extra steps in not being openly critical of China‚Äôs currency policy, launched the high-profile US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, delayed a meeting with the Dalai Lama prior to Obama‚Äôs China trip, and showed substantial patience with China‚Äôs concerns at the Copenhagen conference.', 'But that conciliatory approach, which brought down on Obama domestic criticism, did not seem to be appreciated by the Chinese.', 'Instead, China displayed sharp anger at the US arms sale to Taiwan, something that has been going on for decades, and to Obama‚Äôs low-key meeting with the Dalai Lama.', 'Many in the Obama administration now ask: what is the point of being nice when there are no obvious benefits?', 'On the Chinese side, the initial accommodating approach by Obama, although met with a level of caution and skepticism, was perceived as an inevitable reflection of China‚Äôs rise and more equal status with the US.', 'After all, many argue, China continues to buy US treasury bonds and now shoulders the largest amount of US debt, thus financing whatever the Americans are doing, from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to health-care reform at home.', 'China has played a vital role in getting the global economy onto a speedier path to recovery, thanks to its effective stimulus package.', 'China is also expected to help resolve the nuclear standoffs with North Korea and Iran, two counties that are hostile to the US but less of a threat to China.', 'So China‚Äôs leaders felt a sense of betrayal when Obama, shortly after his positive visit to Beijing, went ahead with the arms sales to Taiwan and the meeting with the Dalai Lama.', 'Many mainstream, liberal-minded Chinese academics complain that there is no fresh US approach to China.', 'Rather, these are old policies that do not accommodate China‚Äôs new status or respond to ‚ÄúChinese kindness.‚Äù', 'The problem is not a lack of communication channels.', 'Both countries have interacted with each other for almost four decades.', 'There are no language problems, few cultural barriers, and plenty of conferences and personal correspondence.', 'We have seen elegant op-eds written on both sides, more or less articulating how one side is right and the other side wrong.', 'The end result?', 'They talk past each other rather than with each other.', 'The fundamental issue in today‚Äôs US-China relations is the strategic visions that both governments are developing to cope with China‚Äôs rise.', 'Americans tend to think that what is good for America must be good for the world.', 'But China ‚Äì and much of the world, for that matter ‚Äì may not agree.', 'Chinese leaders, for their part, tend to believe that nothing matters much if it is not good for China in the first place.', 'Both countries must acknowledge that they have their own domestic and foreign policy priorities.', 'Some may be shared; some not.', 'Others may conflict.', 'To accommodate and bridge their different interests, the US and China need to engage in more than

I visited the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan earlier this year, I met with children who told me what education means to them.', 'For Syrian youths who have been forced from their homes and have lost everything, education is about more than qualifications or test scores; it embodies their hope for the future.', 'Children like those in Zaatari, and millions of others around the world, are central to the work of the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, which I joined last September.', 'This commission is committed to the fourth United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, which aims, by 2030, to ‚Äúensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.‚Äù', 'This goal is still a distant prospect for far too many children.', 'With so many development issues demanding our attention, policymakers should bear in mind that education is not just a good in itself; it is also a catalyst for many other development gains.', 'As the old African proverb goes, if you educate a girl, you educate an entire nation.', 'Ensuring access to quality education for children, especially girls, will lead to fewer child marriages and less child labor and exploitation.', 'And education has long-term societal benefits: aside from increased political engagement, educated children contribute intellectual capital and pursue entrepreneurial opportunities when they grow up, boosting economic growth.', 'Tackling the education challenge needs to start from two principles embedded in the goal.', 'First, ‚Äúfor all‚Äù means that we must focus on the children who have been left behind.', 'Millions of children are out of school or are receiving a substandard education because of who they are or where they live.', 'According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, refugee children are five times more likely to be out of school than other children in the countries to which they‚Äôve been displaced.', 'And in all but two African countries, girls remain less likely than boys to complete a primary education.', 'Getting these children into school will require new approaches that directly address their exclusion and make schooling genuinely accessible and relevant.', 'Second, ‚Äúquality‚Äù: Education must be effective, so that children actually learn.', 'For the 61 million children who are out of primary school, formal education is beyond reach.', 'But, just as urgently, more than one-third of children of primary-school age ‚Äì 250 million ‚Äì are not learning the basics, according to the UNESCO Education for All Global Monitoring Report.', 'Half of these children have been in school for at least four years.', 'We must address the barriers to learning, both in the classroom and at home, by improving the quality of teaching and classroom conditions and teaching parents how they can support their children‚Äôs education.', 'Upholding these two principles will require increased investment.', 'Last year, UNESCO calculated that governments must double education spending as a share of national income to achieve the 2030 goals.', 'This will require increased revenue from taxation and stronger efforts to collect what‚Äôs owed.', 'Donors also need to live up to their aid commitments and target aid more effectively.', 'For example, less than one-third of education aid goes to Africa, even though the region accounts for almost two-thirds of out-of-school children.', 'Moreover, at the moment, education budgets are often regressive, with almost half of spending in the poorest countries allocated to the most educated 10% of the population.', 'Fixing education investment requires action in two key areas.', 'First, we need equitable financing, with more investment in early childhood care and development, where there is the biggest potential for returns.', 'Budgets must be focused on the most excluded children, and primary education must be free at the point of use, so that every child can learn.', 'We also urgently need more transparency and accountability, so that budgets are visible and communities have a say in school governance.', 'Second, we need to strengthen domestic education systems so that governments see themselves as the guarantor of accessible, quality schools for their citizens, rather than abdicating that role to outside development agencies.', 'In particular, we should push for partnerships between government and business to boost domestic resources for education, and eliminate illicit capital flows that deprive governments of the means to fund it, such as tax evasion and money laundering across national borders.', 'With these priorities in mind, the education commission will deliver its recommendations at the UN General Assembly on September 18, when the Secretary-General will receive and act on them.', 'The Education Commission will have succeeded if we are able to leverage the funding and political will to ensure that every child learns, regardless of their income, location, or social status.', 'Our work will not be complete until that happens.', '', 'Achieving Growth in a Rebalanced World', 'MILAN ‚Äì Although the financial crisis is winding down, the prospects for growth in the global economy are unlikely to pick up.', 'This is, in part, inevitable.', 'But it is also the result of poor coordination between governments as the world economy rebalances.', 'Prior to the crisis, American consumers, on average, either saved nothing or accumulated debt.', 'That has now changed.', 'With household wealth seriously damaged by the housing crash and other asset-price declines, pensions and retirement provisions are in disarray.', 'Because asset prices will not reach pre-crisis levels anytime soon (that is, without inflating another bubble and risking renewed instability), household saving in the United States has risen to about 5% of disposable income, and probably will rise further.', 'This withdrawal of the US consumer is part (perhaps half) of the process of rebalancing the global economy.', 'Restoring America‚Äôs savings-investment balance implies a reduction in global aggregate demand of around $800 billion.', 'To be sure, fiscal deficits and emergency measures in advanced economies and some major developing countries have cushioned the sharp decline, substituting in part for missing consumers.', 'But this substitution cannot continue indefinitely.', 'In advanced countries, governments will eventually be forced to reduce spending, and central banks will withdraw from emergency credit provisions and guarantees.', 'As a result, many believe that a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù of slower advanced-country growth is upon us.', 'Despite a recovery in asset prices in many countries and the deceleration of negative growth, unemployment is high and rising.', 'Risk spreads have declined from their mid-crisis highs, but credit in many sectors remains tight or barely available, while the financial sector is set to become more conservative ‚Äì and is likely to be re-regulated with higher capital, reserve, and margin requirements.', 'And this is just the baseline scenario.', 'Downside risks include fiscal destabilization resulting from a failure to rein in deficits, inflation and withdrawal of central bank autonomy, and loss of confidence in the dollar, which continues to be the reserve currency for the global economy.', 'Little wonder, then, that many knowledgeable analysts reasonably expect post-crisis growth in advanced countries to be lower, perhaps by 0.5 to 1%.', 'A 1% slowdown in advanced-country growth translates into roughly $350 billion of missing aggregate demand every year, in addition to the shortfall because of rebalancing in the US.', 'If the slowdown in advanced countries persists, pre-crisis growth levels will not be achievable in the developing world either, owing to insufficient demand to absorb the implied increase in output.', 'Of course, individual developing countries may be spared.', 'But it is an unfortunate mathematical fact that not everyone can gain market share.', 'If the advanced-country scenario is right, many developing countries will lose out and experience sharply diminished growth.', 'Prior to the crisis, many suspected that the mix of aggregate demand that was supporting high growth was unsustainable, though the problem perhaps seemed too hypothetical to compel collective action.', 'Not anymore.', 'But the collective action problem is no less daunting, and it requires urgent attention if the world‚Äôs growth aspirations are to be achieved.', 'The problem is all the more pressing because countries can achieve gains in market share not only through higher private-sector competitiveness, but also by means of protectionist measures.', 'And, as we have seen in many countries‚Äô efforts to ameliorate the crisis, the non-cooperative protectionist response is much more likely to be adopted ‚Äì despite wide recognition that it is highly destructive ‚Äì when aggregate demand is in short supply.', 'So what can be done to shore up global aggregate demand and growth prospects, while preserving the economic openness that has benefited major parts of the developing world so greatly in the past 30 years?', 'First, countries with current-account surpluses such as Germany, Japan and China must recognize that their own growth (and that of others) depends on reducing the global savings-investment imbalance, which will result in narrowing external deficits elsewhere.', 'This needs to be done on a sustained basis following the withdrawal of extraordinary fiscal stimulus.', 'Second, everyone must recognize their stake in restoring balanced advanced-country growth as much and as soon as possible in order to counter the ongoing shortfall in aggregate demand.', 'After all, advanced countries account for about two-thirds of global GDP, so slow growth in these countries will inevitably impede global growth and truncate the growth potential of much of the developing world.', 'This challenge, however, is very complex because deleveraging and rebalancing cannot be completed overnight.', 'But key steps can and should be taken: restoration of fiscal balance in well-communicated plans, commitment to central bank autonomy and low inflation, and striking a thoughtful balance between under- and over-regulation of the financial sector.', 'Externally, major trading partners and holders of advanced-country assets can support rebalancing by agreeing to avoid sudden and potentially destabilizing shifts in the composition of their balance sheets.', 'So, two crucial items must claim priority at the top of the world‚Äôs economic agenda in the months ahead.', 'The first is re-regulation of advanced countries financial systems with a view to ensuring greater stability without impairing essential functions or unnecessarily elevating the cost of capital.', 'The second is a set of understandings and commitments among the major advanced and developing countries to rebalance the global economy in order to restore aggregate demand and growth.', 'If that can be accomplished, the world will have taken a major step toward a relatively smooth, effective, and equitable global economic recovery.', '',

Caucasus, and parts of Central Asia.', 'To maintain momentum in meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, leaders must address three key issues.', 'First, the region‚Äôs economies need to be strengthened to incentivize smarter, more sustainable growth.', 'For example, fossil-fuel subsidies should be reconsidered, because they discourage investment in energy-efficiency projects, and impede the development of renewable technologies.', 'Similarly, while public financing of pensions and welfare programs is dependent on taxing labor, much of the region currently suffers from high rates of unemployment; in the Western Balkans, there are nearly no jobs, or none at all.', 'Job creation is an urgent challenge for every state in the region.', 'Second, in many countries, the space for civil society is becoming narrower, posing a threat to pluralism and accountability.', 'To prevent conflict and give voice to the region‚Äôs marginalized groups, tolerance and respect for human rights must be made essential ingredients of governance.', 'Finally, the region must coordinate on strategies to address the changes that automation and artificial intelligence will bring to the labor market.', 'Leaders in some countries, particularly Belarus, are shifting economic output from heavy manufacturing to technology startups.', 'But authorities everywhere can do more to

flawed.', 'The US president-elect wants to restore growth via deficit spending in a country with a chronic shortfall of saving.', 'This points to a further compression in national saving, making a widening of an already outsize trade gap all but inevitable.', 'That dynamic unmasks the Achilles‚Äô heel of Trumponomics: a blatant protectionist bias that collides head-on with America‚Äôs inescapable reliance on foreign saving and trade deficits to sustain economic growth.', 'The Trump administration will not inherit a strong and sound US economy.', 'The pace of recovery since the Great Recession has been running at half that of normal cyclical rebounds ‚Äì all the more disturbing given the massive size of the contraction in 2008-09.', 'And savings, the seed corn of future prosperity, remain in woefully short supply.', 'The so-called net national saving rate ‚Äì the depreciation-adjusted sum of business, household, and government saving ‚Äì stood at just 2.4% of national income in mid-2016.', 'While that‚Äôs an improvement from the unprecedented negative saving position in 2008-2011, it remains far short of the 6.3% average that prevailed over the final three decades of the twentieth century.', 'This is important because it explains the pernicious trade deficits that Trump continues to rail against.', 'Lacking in saving and wanting to grow, the United States must import surplus saving from abroad.', 'And the only way to attract that foreign capital is by running massive current-account and trade deficits.', 'The numbers bear this out: since 2000, when national saving fell well below trend, the current-account deficit has widened to an average of 3.8% of GDP ‚Äì nearly four times the 1% gap from 1970 to 1999.', 'Similarly, the net export deficit ‚Äì the broadest measure of a country‚Äôs trade imbalance ‚Äì has been 4% of GDP since 2000, versus an average of 1.1% over the final three decades of the twentieth century.', 'Trumponomics has the cause and effect behind this development backwards.', 'It fixates on country-specific sources of the trade deficit, like China and Mexico, but misses the fundamental point that these bilateral deficits are symptoms of America‚Äôs far deeper saving problem.', 'Presume for the moment that the US closes down trade with China and Mexico ‚Äì the first and fourth largest components of the overall trade deficit ‚Äì through a combination of tariffs and other protectionist measures (including the proposed renegotiation of NAFTA and a Mexican-funded border wall).', 'Without addressing America‚Äôs chronic saving shortage, the Chinese and Mexican components of the trade deficit would simply be redistributed to other countries ‚Äì most likely to higher-cost producers.', 'The result would be the functional equivalent of a tax hike on beleaguered middle-class US families.', 'In short, there is no bilateral fix for a multilateral problem.', 'The US had trade deficits with 101 countries in 2015

should be let off the hook for unfair practices.', 'But it does mean that there is limited hope for resolving seemingly chronic trade deficits ‚Äì and the related erosion of domestic hiring traceable to these imbalances ‚Äì if the US doesn‚Äôt start saving again.', 'Alas, this plot is about to thicken.', 'Trumponomics seems likely to exacerbate America‚Äôs saving shortfall in the years ahead.', 'Analyses by the Tax Policy Center, the Tax Foundation, and Moody‚Äôs Analytics all indicate that federal budget deficits under Trump‚Äôs economic plan are headed back toward at least 7% of GDP over the next ten years.', \"Trump‚Äôs senior economic-policy advisers, Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross (Trump's pick for commerce secretary), argued in a position paper in September that these estimates are flawed, because they don‚Äôt take into account ‚Äúgrowth-inducing windfalls‚Äù from regulatory and energy reforms, or the added bonanza that should arise from a sharp narrowing of America‚Äôs trade deficit.\", 'Indeed, the Navarro-Ross analysis attributes fully 73% of the growth-inducing revenue windfall of Trumponomics to a massive improvement in the overall trade balance over the next decade.', 'Yet, as stressed above, barring a miraculous surge in national saving, this is highly dubious.', 'Creative accounting, long a staple of supply-side economics, has never been more imaginative.', 'Therein lies one of the most glaring disconnects of Trumponomics.', 'Getting tough on trade at a time when national saving is about to come under ever-greater pressure simply doesn‚Äôt add up.', 'Even the most conservative estimates of the federal budget deficit suggest that the already-depressed net national saving rate could re-enter negative territory at some point in the 2018-2019 period.', 'That would put renewed pressure on the current-account and trade deficits, making it extremely difficult to reverse the loss of jobs and income that politicians are quick to blame on America‚Äôs trading partners.', 'Ironically, in the coming era of negative saving, the US will find itself increasingly dependent on surplus saving from abroad.', 'If the Trump administration takes aim at major foreign lenders ‚Äì namely, China ‚Äì its strategy could quickly backfire.', 'At a minimum, there could be an adverse impact on the terms by which America borrows from abroad; that could mean higher interest rates ‚Äì hints of which are already evident ‚Äì and ultimately downward pressure on the dollar.', 'And, of course, there is the worst-case scenario of an escalating global trade war.', 'Protectionism, anemic saving, and deficit spending make for an especially toxic cocktail.', 'Under Trumponomics, it will be exceedingly difficult to make America great again.', '', 'A Chinese Champion of Peace and Freedom', 'PRAGUE ‚Äì On Christmas Day last year, one of China‚Äôs best-known human rights activists, the writer and university professor Liu Xiaobo, was condemned to 11 years in prison.', 'Liu is one of the main drafters of Charter 08, a petition inspired by Czechoslovakia‚Äôs Charter 77, calling on the Chinese government to adhere to its own laws and constitution, and demanding the open election of public officials, freedom of religion and expression, and the abolition of ‚Äúsubversion‚Äù laws.', 'For his bravery and clarity of thought about China‚Äôs future, Liu deserves the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.', 'There are two reasons why we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of that prestigious award.', 'First and foremost, he stands in the tradition of Nobel Peace Prize laureates who have been recognized for their contribution to the struggle for human rights.', 'Nobel laureates such as Martin Luther King, Lech Walesa, and Aung San Suu Kyi are but a few of the many examples that the Nobel Committee has recognized in previous years.', 'We are convinced that the concepts that Liu and his colleagues put down on paper in December 2008 are both universal and timeless.', 'These ideals ‚Äì respect for human rights and human dignity, and the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their governments respect those rights ‚Äì represent humanity‚Äôs highest aspirations.', 'Should the Nobel Committee choose to recognize Liu‚Äôs courage and sacrifice in articulating these ideals, it would not only draw global attention to the injustice of Liu‚Äôs 11-year sentence.', 'It would also help to amplify within China the universal and humanistic values for which Liu has spent so much of his life fighting.', 'The second reason why Liu deserves the Nobel Peace Prize resonates with Alfred Nobel‚Äôs original intent for the award.', 'In working to promote human rights, political reform, and democratization in China, Liu has made a significant contribution to the values of peace and fraternity among nations that Nobel had in mind when he created the award more than a century ago.', 'Of course, democratization does not automatically guarantee better behavior on the world stage.', 'But it does facilitate a full and rigorous public debate over key questions of a state‚Äôs foreign and domestic policies.', 'This active and searching conversation, the hallmark of a democratic polity, is the best hope for better decisions by governments, both at home and abroad.', 'Liu‚Äôs committed advocacy on behalf of democracy in China is, above all, intended for the benefit of the Chinese people.', 'But his courage and example may help to accelerate the dawn of the day when China‚Äôs participation in international affairs is aided by the expertise and oversight of civil-society groups, an independent media, and an engaged citizenry able to express its views through the ballot box.', 'It is primarily for these two reasons that we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.', 'In conferring on Liu one of the world‚Äôs highest honors, the Committee would be signaling once again the importance of human rights and democracy on the one hand, and world peace and international solidarity on the other.', 'Liu‚Äôs harsh prison sentence was meant as an exemplary measure, a stern warning to all other Chinese who might want to follow his path.', 'We are convinced that there are moments when exemplary civic engagement, such as Liu‚Äôs, requires an exemplary response.', 'Awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize is precisely the response that his courage deserves.', '', 'A Civilization in Crisis', '', 'A Clarion Call for Emerging Markets', 'ITHACA ‚Äì With 2012 underway, it is worth reflecting on how a decade of strong economic growth in emerging markets led to last year‚Äôs resounding political transformations.', 'From the dramatic events in the Middle East, to the groundswell of support for the anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare in India, leaders in emerging markets are getting a clear message from the streets that growth is not everything.', 'They ignore this message at their peril.', 'Emerging-market economies delivered solid growth during the 2000‚Äôs, and even survived the global financial crisis without a growth collapse.', 'But the specter of rising corruption is compromising the legitimacy of their economic gains and eroding support for further reforms needed to sustain their growth momentum.', 'Corruption takes many forms, but, in emerging markets, a combination of factors has turned it into a cancer that ultimately topples regimes.', 'Relentless low-level corruption is a major irritant for poor people in many of these countries; indeed, it limits their access to the social services and basic government functions that they often depend upon for their very survival.', 'Another type of corruption involves siphoning enormous sums of money from large-scale projects.', 'In India, for example, the government lost as much as $30-40 billion of much-needed revenue when coveted band spectrum was sold through a rigged auction.', 'For ordinary people, large-scale corruption is less visible, because, while the sums involved are mind-boggling, the costs are not as directly felt as they are in the case of lower-level graft.', 'But the perception of this type of mega-corruption has changed as rapid growth has increased inequality.', 'In countries like China and India, rapid economic growth has lifted a huge number of people out of poverty.', 'But the fruits of globalization and rapid growth have not been evenly shared ‚Äì the rich become super-rich, even as a large fraction of the population remains destitute.', 'Rising income inequality is hardly limited to emerging markets, but their combination of open corruption and pervasive inequities creates a toxic brew that is undermining support for reforms that would strengthen and consolidate their economic gains.', 'In many emerging markets, a lack of political freedom adds to the combustible mix.', 'The combination of corruption, inequality, and political repression builds up enormous pressure, and there are no institutional channels through which to release it.', 'But freer political regimes are not a panacea.', 'In a democracy like India‚Äôs, the politically well-connected benefit from skewed growth, thus increasing the resentment of those left behind.', 'The opportunity to ‚Äúthrow the rascals out‚Äù in each election cycle helps to let off some steam, but it does not resolve the problems that are generating it.', 'It is difficult to predict what triggers popular protest, but economic factors are key.', 'For example, rising food prices tend to hurt the poor, especially the urban poor, who spend a large share of their income on food; unlike agricultural workers, they receive none of the benefits of higher food prices.', 'With swelling urban populations, it will become increasingly difficult to keep a lid on these pressures.', 'Some governments have reacted to recent events with political repression, information blackouts, or a combination of authoritarian measures.', 'China, for example, blocked media coverage of the Egyptian protests.', 'The Arab Spring, however, reveals the fragility of repressive political regimes that try to maintain their legitimacy by limiting information flows.', 'The main lesson for dynamic emerging-market countries is that an exclusive focus on GDP growth may ultimately not be good for economic and political stability.', 'Even with rapid increases in national income, if these countries‚Äô leaders do not distribute the benefits fairly, they will become vulnerable to popular discontent.', 'Tackling corruption is critical to improving long-term growth and maintaining social stability.', 'These economies need measures that help to keep the poor out of poverty traps, and that give them realistic opportunities to improve their economic well-being.', 'Such steps include broadening financial markets to give more people access to credit and investment, strengthening social safety nets to protect the economically vulnerable, and improving educational access and quality.', 'These lessons apply equally to advanced economies, which also suffer from rising inequality and subtle forms of corruption.', 'But, for those wealthy economies, restoring decent growth is now the major priority.', 'Emerging markets have a golden opportunity to build on their economic gains and lock in growth and stability by tackling deep-seated problems like corruption.', 'As the past year‚Äôs events have shown, the costs of inaction could be calamitous.', '', 'A Climate Deal is Not Enough', 'AMSTERDAM ‚Äì During the COP15 climate summit in Copenhagen, world leaders have been negotiating the future of our planet.', 'All the signs suggest that they are unlikely to sign a global climate treaty.', 'The views of the various countries, and of the various industrial and political power blocs, differ too much.', 'The politicians, civil servants, and other participants at the Copenhagen summit have mainly been bombarding each other with numbers.', 'Figures on how much various countries should reduce CO2 emissions, the amount of money they should put up in coming years, the exact nature of their responsibilities, how much temperature increase Earth will be able to endure, and how long we can continue to wait.', 'These are all very important issues.', 'But the mere figures are simply not enough.', 'A different approach to the problem of climate change is needed.', 'The climate issue can only be solved on the basis of shared, deeply felt ethical principles.', 'Humanity has reached a critical moment in Earth‚Äôs history, at which peoples and nations will have to recognize their solidarity ‚Äì with each other and with the Earth ‚Äì and start acting upon it.', 'Similar to the way world leaders adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration in September 2000, and embraced the resulting Millennium Development Goals, today‚Äôs climate negotiators will have to commit themselves to creating a basis of shared fundamental ethical principles.', 'Such a basis is not hard to find.', 'Its inspiration can be the Earth Charter, which, launched in 2000, was initiated by, among others, former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev and Wangari Mathaai, who received the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts in the Green Belt Movement, a pan-African tree-planting initiative.', 'The climate problem does not stop at borders.', 'In the next few decades, a low-lying country like the Netherlands will need to invest billions of euros to intensify its age-old struggle against rising water.', 'But in many other countries, the water is already flooding over the dikes, both literally and figuratively.', 'Climate change affects particularly those countries that lack the money needed to take adequate measures against rising sea levels, persistent droughts, or devastating storms, even though they had nothing to do with the primary cause of these problems ‚Äì industrialization in the developed countries.', 'Apart from the necessary, often infrastructural adaptations to survive the effects of climate change, enormous efforts to prevent even worse things from happening are required.', 'Large investments in forestation, agriculture, and energy supply are called for.', 'In devising solutions, the role of women should be the main focus.', 'Women are often the first people who have to address the problem of gaining access to natural resources, and they are capable of playing a major role as pioneers in finding solutions to climate change and the way humankind should adapt to it.', 'In the short term, the world should become a sustainable global society of low CO2 emitters.', 'This is a mission for all humankind, in which patriotic feelings and thinking in terms of power blocs have no place.', 'The pursuit of a sustainable global society of low CO2 emitters requires a tremendous effort.', 'Precisely for this reason, it also requires a broadly shared ethical basis.', 'This would guide the negotiating parties in such a way that they look not only for solutions to a part of the problem, but first and foremost at a comprehensive solution to the entire problem.', 'The climate change issue is too important to be left in the care of politicians.', 'In Copenhagen, it is therefore imperative that not only nation states, but the business community and citizens combine their efforts to save our planet‚Äôs climate.', 'That is not only a scientific necessity; it is an ethical imperative.', '', 'A Clockwork Chemistry', 'OXFORD ‚Äì In Anthony

is being programmed to respond with nausea to violence and sex.', 'This scene remains shocking, but, like most science fiction, it has aged.', 'The behaviorist psychology it drew upon has long expired, and the fear that science will be used to make, or even force, people to be morally better now sounds old-fashioned.', 'Science fiction ages fast, but it has a long afterlife.', 'Over the past decade, an army of psychologists, neuroscientists, and evolutionary biologists has been busy trying to uncover the neural ‚Äúclockwork‚Äù that underlies human morality.', 'They have started to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social sentiments such as empathy, and have begun to uncover the genes that dispose some individuals to senseless violence and others to acts of altruism, and the pathways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions.', 'And to understand how something works is also to begin to see ways to modify and even control it.', 'Indeed, scientists have not only identified some of the brain pathways that shape our ethical decisions, but also chemical substances that modulate this neural activity.', 'A recent study has shown that the anti-depressant Citalopram can change the responses of individuals to hypothetical moral dilemma scenarios.', 'Individuals given the drug were less willing to sacrifice an individual to save the lives of several others.', 'Another series of studies has shown that when the hormone oxytocin is administered via nasal spray, it increases trusting and cooperative behavior within social groups, but also decreases cooperation with those perceived as outsiders.', 'Neuroscientists have even magnetically ‚Äúzapped‚Äù carefully targeted areas of people‚Äôs brains to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways ‚Äì for example, making it easier for them to lie.', 'Of course, no one is developing a ‚Äúmoral pill‚Äù that will transform us into saints.', 'But the research is advancing fast, and it is almost certain to suggest new ways to reshape our moral intuitions, sentiments, and motivations.', 'Should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human morality to try to make people morally better?', 'A Clockwork Orange was accused of glorifying violence, and some of its scenes are still hard to watch.', 'But as Burgess himself argued, the novella has an almost Christian message: what makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil, and for society to crush individuals into servile conformity is as wicked as, and perhaps even worse than, the sadism of psychopaths like Alex.', 'I suspect that many will agree with this view.', 'They will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something precious that we should safeguard, not a broken clock that scientists should fix.', 'Of course, most of us don‚Äôt need to be conditioned to feel repulsed by rape or torture.', 'But this does not mean that we are morally good, or good enough.', 'As you read this, perfectly ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others.', 'Even in the most advanced and affluent societies, a vast concentrated effort is needed to preserve even minimal decency: think of locks, security alarms, police, courts, and prisons.', 'And it is doubtful that we really care enough about others, or give enough to the less fortunate.', 'Humans are born with the capacity to be moral, but it is a limited capacity which is ill equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world.', 'For thousands of years, humans have relied on education, persuasion, social institutions, and the threat of real (or supernatural) punishment to make people behave decently.', 'We could all be morally better, but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further.', 'It is not as if people would suddenly begin to behave better if we just gave them more facts and statistics, or better arguments.', 'So we shouldn‚Äôt be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science might help ‚Äì in the first instance, by helping us design more effective institutions, more inspiring moral education, or more persuasive ethical arguments.', 'But science might also offer more direct ways of influencing our brains.', 'Science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible.', 'It would be self-defeating, or worse, to try to promote morality through brutal coercion.', 'Governments must not be given the power to control its citizens‚Äô moral code ‚Äì we know that if they had such power, they would misuse it.', 'It would be ideal if individuals could freely explore different ways to improve themselves, whether by practicing mindfulness, reading moral philosophy, or, yes, by taking a ‚Äômorality‚Äô pill.', 'But it is also true that although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster, it is not so obvious that people would really want to take pills that would make them morally better.', 'It is not clear that people really want to be morally better.', 'And those who, like the psychopathic Alex, need the most help are probably those who

over Airplane Safety', 'PRINCETON ‚Äì When airports across Europe reopened after the closure caused by the eruption of Iceland‚Äôs Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano, it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had dropped, but because the risk that the ash posed to airplane safety had been reassessed.', 'Was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the flight ban, or was it a reflection of the hardship, both personal and economic, that the ban was causing?', 'Over six days, about 95,000 flights were canceled, at a cost to airlines of more than $1 billion.', 'An estimated five million people were stranded or delayed.', 'The British economy lost ¬£1.5 billion, and others were similarly affected.', 'Flower growers in Kenya, who depend on air transport to take their short-lived product to Europe, suddenly had no income.', 'Sixteen cancer patients in critical need of bone marrow for transplants were put at risk because the matching marrow could not be flown in from the United States or Canada.', 'In the past, jets flying into ash from volcanoes in the US, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Mexico have temporarily lost engine power, and in one case, dropped thousands of feet, although all managed to land safely.', 'But there was no evidence that the more widely dispersed ash blowing over Europe from Iceland would cause similar problems.', 'The decision to ground flights was based on the view that any level of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft, and that no matter how slight that risk might be, the government‚Äôs job was, as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown put it, ‚Äúto make sure that safety was paramount.‚Äù', 'Indeed, in closing their skies, European governments seem to have given safety absolute priority over everything else.', 'Yet none of them act on that principle in other areas.', 'Some 3,000 people die on the world‚Äôs roads every day.', 'Cutting speed limits to, say, 10 kilometers per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives.', 'We don‚Äôt do it, because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving.', 'The price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite.', 'It is distasteful to put a price on human life, but the more we spend on safety, the less we will have for our other goals.', 'The British government uses a figure of a little more than ¬£1 million as a general limit to the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life ‚Äì for example, by improving road safety.', 'In the US, the Department of Transportation is prepared to go up to $5.8 million ‚Äì nearly four times as much, at current exchange rates ‚Äì for the same purpose.', 'Does that mean that safety is paramount in the US, but not in Britain?', 'Giovanni Bisignani, the head of the International Air Transport Association, an industry group, criticized the shutdown, saying that no risk assessment had been undertaken.', 'On the whole, though, the public seemed to support the decision.', 'Stranded travelers, interviewed at airports, typically said that they would rather be stuck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky.', 'But what if some travelers have a higher tolerance of risk, or just a more urgent need to travel, than others?', 'John Stuart Mill, in his classic book On Liberty, considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe.', 'In Mill‚Äôs view, we are justified in stopping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger.', 'Once he knows of it, the decision is his to make,

those with claims to it.', 'And, over time, Israeli settler disengagement from the West Bank and East Jerusalem has become just as impossible as any attempt by Israel to expel its remaining Arabs.', 'Israeli Jews are bound to stay in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israeli Arabs are bound to stay in Israel proper.', 'These are the ‚Äúfacts on the ground‚Äù that doom Palestinian hopes for a sovereign Palestinian state no less than Israeli hopes for a wholly Jewish state.', 'Moreover, land for peace never made sense from an economic point of view.', 'If compensation for wrongs to the Palestinians was to be the guiding principle, there were always better ways of going about it than to found a rickety, poverty-ridden new country dependent on foreign aid.', 'Most people have forgotten that the Paris Protocols of April 1994 established a customs union between Israel and the occupied territories, with a joint Economic Council to adjudicate trade disputes.', 'The free movement of goods, labor, and capital between the two parts could have given a tremendous economic boost to Palestinian GDP.', 'It could also have been the basis of a confederal state, whose

unilaterally ‚Äì a move that the United States has announced it may support.', 'That would be a disastrous step.', 'Russia would be furious, because it fears that Kosovo‚Äôs secession ‚Äì whether or not it is internationally recognized ‚Äì might fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire.', 'Serbia is even more strongly opposed.', 'Dusan Prorokovic, Serbia‚Äôs state secretary for Kosovo, has said that his country might use force to maintain its sovereignty.', 'Even if the government hesitates, ultranationalist groups might push Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to send in troops: the current UN presence in Kosovo is very thin (only 40 ‚Äúmilitary observers‚Äù and 2,116 policemen) but the stationing of 15,000 NATO troops could make any armed clash very dangerous.', 'After eight years of international administration, Kosovo‚Äôs Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is eager for full independence.', 'But Serbia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition.', 'Moreover, independence would not be accepted by the Serbian public, which has already watched in dismay as ‚ÄúGreat Serbia‚Äù has been gradually whittled away, most recently with the secession of Montenegro.', 'Serbia is prepared to concede only ‚Äúenhanced autonomy‚Äù to Kosovo, and some capacity to enter into international agreements.', 'Yet, while the two parties now seem irreconcilable, it is not too late for compromise.', 'But this is possible only by resuscitating ‚Äì and updating ‚Äì an old institution of the international community: a confederation of states.', 'By means of a binding UN Security Council resolution, Kosovo could be granted full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory, as well as limited capacity for action on the international scene.', 'It could be authorized to enter into trade agreements as well as agreements concerning individuals (for example, admission and circulation of foreigners, or extradition), plus the right to seek admission to the UN (which does not require full sovereignty and independence).', 'Kosovo would thus gain some essential trappings of statehood.', 'However, a decision-making body consisting of delegates from Kosovo, Serbia, and the European Union would be given full authority over major foreign policy issues (for example, alliances and relations with international economic institutions), defence, borders (in case Kosovo wished to join with Albania), and the treatment of Kosovo‚Äôs Serbian minority.', 'As a result, Kosovo and Serbia would constitute two distinct international subjects, bound by a confederation hinging on a common decision-making body.', 'Of course, this confederation would be asymmetrical, because the Serbian government‚Äôs sovereignty over the rest of Serbia would remain intact and unlimited, whereas the Kosovar government‚Äôs ‚Äúsovereignty‚Äù over Kosovo would be restrained.', 'To avoid one of the two parties getting the upper hand and imposing arbitrary decisions, the common decision-making body should consist of four Serbian delegates, two Kosovar delegates, and three representatives of the EU, thus requiring both sides to gain the support of the European delegates.', 'In addition, the EU should create a small but effective military force (say, 5,000 troops) to back up the common body‚Äôs decisions.', 'As with any compromise, the contending parties would both gain and lose from this arrangement.', 'Serbia would save face, and would continue to have a say on crucial matters concerning Kosovo, including the treatment of the Serbian minority.', 'Kosovo would acquire limited independence, with its status rising from a province of a sovereign state to an international subject capable of entering into certain agreements with other states and even joining the UN.', 'The EU would benefit as well, by contributing to the stabilization of a highly volatile area.', 'Subsequently, the EU would monitor Kosovo and prevent any dispute that might turn violent.', 'A final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary.', 'Historically, confederations sooner or later either become federations (as occurred in the US, Germany, and Switzerland) or, pushed by centrifugal forces, split up (as with the United Arab Republic, established in 1958, which split three years later into Egypt and Syria).', 'The confederation I advocate would thus constitute an intermediate stage (lasting five or ten years), at the end of which Kosovo is likely to become fully independent.', 'Delaying a final solution in this way would provide time to verify Kosovo‚Äôs prospects of joining the EU and thus eventually sharing ‚Äúsovereign authority‚Äù with other independent states, which could deflate Kosovars‚Äô dangerously robust nationalistic demands.', '', 'A Conservative Europe', 'Last week Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, and Gerhard Schroeder met in Berlin.', \"They departed pledging to

consigned in the past, and sometimes into the very heart of politics.', 'I learned this by accident.', 'Having written a book about the hijacking of executive power in the United States in the Bush years, I found myself, in researching new developments, stumbling upon conversations online that embrace narratives of behind-the-scenes manipulation.', 'There are some major themes.', 'A frequent one in the US is that global elites are plotting ‚Äì via the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations, among others ‚Äì to establish a ‚ÄúOne World Government‚Äù dominated by themselves rather than national governments.', 'Sometimes, more folkloric details come into play, broadening the members of this cabal to include the Illuminati, the Freemasons, Rhodes Scholars, or, as always, the Jews.', 'The hallmarks of this narrative are familiar to anyone who has studied the transmission of certain story categories in times of crisis.', 'In literary terms, this conspiracy theory closely resembles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , featuring secretive global elite with great power and wicked aims.', 'Historically, there tends to be the same set of themes: fearsome, uncontrolled transformative change led by educated, urbanized cosmopolitans.', 'Students of Weimar Germany know that sudden dislocations and shocks ‚Äì rapid urbanization, disruption of traditional family and social ties, loosening of sexual restrictions, and economic collapse ‚Äì primed many Germans to become receptive to simplistic theories that seemed to address their confusion and offer a larger meaning to their suffering.', 'Similarly, the ‚Äú9/11 Truth Movement‚Äù asserts that al-Qaeda‚Äôs attack on the Twin Towers was an ‚Äúinside job.‚Äù', 'In the Muslim world, there is a widespread conspiracy theory that the Israelis were behind those attacks, and that all Jews who worked in the buildings stayed home that day.', 'Usually, conspiracy theories surface where people are poorly educated and a rigorous independent press is lacking.', 'So why are such theories gaining adherents in the US and other affluent democracies nowadays?', 'Today‚Äôs explosion of conspiracy theories has been stoked by the same conditions that drove their acceptance in the past: rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty.', 'A clearly designated ‚Äúenemy‚Äù with an unmistakable ‚Äúplan‚Äù is psychologically more comforting than the chaotic evolution of social norms and the workings ‚Äì or failures ‚Äì of unfettered capitalism.', 'And, while conspiracy theories are often

represent them.', 'Hence their impulse to believe in unseen forces.', 'Finally, even rational people have become more receptive to certain conspiracy theories because, in the last eight years, we

'Written under the leadership of Sir Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, who succeeded me as Chief Economist of the World Bank, the report makes clear that the question is no longer whether we can afford to do anything about global warming, but whether we can afford not to.', 'The report proposes an agenda whose cost would be equivalent to just 1% of annual consumption, but would save the world risk equivalent costs that are five times greater.', 'The reported costs of global warming are higher than in earlier studies because it takes into account the mounting evidence that the process of global warming is highly complex and non-linear, with a non-negligible chance that it may proceed much faster than had previously been thought and that the extent of warming may be much greater than had previously been thought.', 'Indeed, the study may actually significantly underestimate the costs: for instance, climate change may lead to more weather variability, a possible disappearance or major shift of the Gulf Stream ‚Äì of particular concern to Europe ‚Äì and a flourishing of disease.', 'When I served in 1995 on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific group that periodically assesses the science of global warming, there was overwhelming evidence that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had increased markedly since the beginning of the industrial revolution, that human activity had contributed significantly to those increases, and that they would have profound effects on climate and sea levels.', 'But few saw, for instance, the Artic ice cap melting as rapidly as now seems to be the case.', 'Still, some suggest that because we are not certain about how bad global warming will be, we should do little or nothing.', 'To me, uncertainty should make us act more resolutely today, not less.', 'As one scientist friend puts it: if you are driving on a mountain road, approaching a cliff, in a car whose brakes may fail, and a fog bank rolls in, should you drive more or less cautiously?', 'Global warming is one of those rare instances where the scientific community is more fearful of what may be happening than the population at large.', 'Scientists have glimpsed what the future may portend.', 'As the Stern report points out, as usual, the poor are the most vulnerable.', 'A third of Bangladesh will be underwater by the end of this century.', 'The Maldives and a host of Pacific Island states will disappear: our twenty-first-century Atlantis.', 'To an economist, the problem is obvious: polluters are not paying the full costs of the damage they cause.', 'Pollution is a global externality of enormous proportions.', 'The advanced countries might mean Bangladesh and the disappearing island states no harm, but no war could be more devastating.', 'A global externality can best be dealt with by a globally agreed tax rate.', 'This does not mean an increase in overall taxation, but simply a substitution in each country of a pollution (carbon) tax for some current taxes.', 'It makes much more sense to tax things that are bad, like pollution, than things that are good, like savings and work.', 'Although President George W.

undermine confidence in the science of global warming, just as the tobacco industry funded ‚Äúresearch‚Äù to question the validity of statistical findings showing the link between smoking and cancer.', 'Some companies even seem to celebrate the melting of the polar ice cap, because it will reduce the cost of extracting the oil that lies beneath the Arctic Ocean.', 'The good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions ‚Äì partly by eliminating the myriad of subsidies for inefficient usages.', 'The US subsidizes corn-based ethanol, and imposes tariffs on sugar-based ethanol; hidden in the tax code are billions of dollars of subsidies to the oil and gas industries.', 'Most importantly, price signals that show the true social costs of energy derived from fossil fuels will encourage innovation and conservation.', 'Small changes in practices, when replicated by hundreds of millions of people, can make an enormous difference.', 'For example,

banking system had calmed global financial markets.', 'But now interest rates for Italian and Spanish government bonds are on the rise again, closing in on about 6%.', 'Of course, this may not be the breaking point beyond which the debt burden becomes unsustainable.', 'After all, interest rates in Southern Europe were well above 10% in the decade before the euro was introduced.', 'Even Germany at that time had to pay bondholders more than 6%.', 'Nevertheless, the markets are clearly signaling growing doubt about whether Spain and Italy will be willing to bear their debt burden.', 'The main problem is Spain, where private and public-sector foreign debt is larger than that of Greece, Portugal, Ireland, and Italy combined, and, as in Greece, is in the neighborhood of 100% of GDP (93% to be precise).', 'A quarter of the labor force and half of Spain‚Äôs youth are unemployed, reflecting the country‚Äôs loss of competitiveness in the wake of the real-estate bubble inflated by cheap euro credit in the pre-crisis period.', 'The current-account deficit remains at 3.5% of GDP, despite the recession-induced decline in imports, while economic contraction will cause Spain to miss its budget-deficit target again.', 'Moreover, Spain‚Äôs debt with the ECB‚Äôs TARGET settlement system rose by ‚Ç¨55 billion ($72 billion) between February and March, because capital outflows of that amount had to be compensated.', 'Since July 2011, Spain‚Äôs TARGET debt has grown by ‚Ç¨199 billion.', 'Capital is in full flight, more than offsetting the inflows from 2008-2010.', 'The cumulative total since the beginning of the first crisis year (2008) means that Spain has financed its entire current-account deficit via the printing press.', 'The picture is little better in Italy, where the current-account balance has swung from a surplus of around 2% of GDP to a 3%-of-GDP deficit over the last ten years.', 'The country‚Äôs TARGET debt grew by ‚Ç¨76 billion from February to March, with the total since July 2011 reaching ‚Ç¨276 billion.', 'Italy, too, is being drained of capital; in fact, the flight of investors accelerated after the ECB‚Äôs liquidity injection.', 'It is now clear that the ECB itself has caused a large part of the capital flight from countries like Spain and Italy, because the cheap credit that it offered drove away private capital.', 'The purpose of the ECB‚Äôs measures was to re-establish confidence and bring about a recovery of the inter-bank market.', 'In this, too, it has not really been successful, despite the huge amount of money that it put on the table.', 'Indeed, now the French are looking wobbly.', 'As capital fled the country between July 2011 and January 2012, France‚Äôs TARGET debt increased by ‚Ç¨95 billion.', 'France, too, has

vis-√†-vis the euro average ‚Äì that is, depreciate in real terms ‚Äì if the economy is to regain competitiveness within the eurozone.', 'Italy will have to depreciate by 10-15%, and Spain by roughly 20%.', 'While Greece and Portugal face the need for deflation totaling 30% and 35%, respectively, the figures for Spain and Italy are high enough to justify fears about the future development of the eurozone.', 'These imbalances can be redressed only with great effort, if at all, and only if one accepts a decade of stagnation.', 'For Greece and Portugal, staying in the eurozone will be a tight squeeze.', 'There are many who would solve the problem by routing more and more cheap credit through public channels ‚Äì bailout funds, eurobonds, or the ECB ‚Äì from the eurozone‚Äôs healthy core to

Dutch, and Finish savings amounting to ‚Ç¨15,000, ‚Ç¨17,000, and ‚Ç¨21,000, respectively, per working person have been converted from marketable investments into mere equalization claims against the ECB.', 'No one knows what these claims will be worth in the event of a eurozone breakup.', 'Above all, however, the permanent public provision of cheap credit would ultimately lead to a lingering infirmity, if not to Europe‚Äôs economic collapse, because the eurozone would become a central management system with state control over investment.', 'Such systems cannot work, because they eliminate the capital market as the economic system‚Äôs main steering mechanism.', 'One cannot help but wonder how thoughtlessly Europe‚Äôs politicians have started down this slippery slope.', '', 'A Crisis in Two Narratives', 'CHICAGO ‚Äì With the world‚Äôs industrial democracies in crisis, two competing narratives of its sources ‚Äì and appropriate remedies ‚Äì are emerging.', 'The first, better-known diagnosis is that demand has collapsed because of high debt accumulated prior to the crisis.', 'Households (and countries) that were most prone to spend cannot borrow any more.', 'To revive growth, others must be encouraged to spend ‚Äì governments that can still borrow should run larger deficits, and rock-bottom interest rates should discourage thrifty households from saving.', 'Under these circumstances, budgetary recklessness is a virtue, at least in the short term.', 'In the medium term, once growth revives, debt can be paid down and the financial sector curbed so that it does not inflict another crisis on the world.', 'This narrative ‚Äì the standard Keynesian line, modified for a debt crisis ‚Äì is the one to which most government officials, central bankers, and Wall Street economists have subscribed, and needs little elaboration.', 'Its virtue is that it gives policymakers something clear to do, with promised returns that match the political cycle.', 'Unfortunately, despite past stimulus, growth is still tepid, and it is increasingly difficult to find sensible new spending that can pay off in the short run.', 'Attention is therefore shifting to the second narrative, which suggests that the advanced economies‚Äô fundamental capacity to grow by making useful things has been declining for decades, a trend that was masked by debt-fueled spending.', 'More such spending will not return these countries to a sustainable growth path.', 'Instead, they must improve the environment for growth.', 'The second narrative starts with the 1950‚Äôs and 1960‚Äôs, an era of rapid growth in the West and Japan.', 'Several factors, including post-war reconstruction, the resurgence of trade after the protectionist 1930‚Äôs, the introduction of new technologies in power, transport, and communications across countries, and expansion of educational attainment, underpinned the long boom.', 'But, as Tyler Cowen has argued in his book The Great Stagnation, once these ‚Äúlow-hanging fruit‚Äù were plucked, it became much harder to propel growth from the 1970‚Äôs onward.', 'Meanwhile, as Wolfgang Streeck writes persuasively in New Left Review, democratic governments, facing what seemed, in the 1960‚Äôs, like an endless vista of innovation and growth, were quick to expand the welfare state.', 'But, when growth faltered, this meant that government spending expanded, even as its resources shrank.', 'For a while, central banks accommodated that spending.', 'The resulting high inflation created widespread discontent, especially because little growth resulted.', 'Faith in Keynesian stimulus diminished, though high inflation did reduce public-debt levels.', 'Central banks then began to focus on low and stable inflation as their primary objective, and became more independent from their political masters.', 'But deficit spending by governments continued apace, and public debt as a share of GDP in industrial countries climbed steadily from the late 1970‚Äôs, this time without inflation to reduce its real value.', 'Recognizing the need to find new sources of growth, towards the end of Jimmy Carter‚Äôs presidency, and then under Ronald Reagan, the United States deregulated industry and the financial sector, as did Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom.', 'Productivity growth increased substantially in these countries over time, which persuaded Continental Europe to adopt reforms of its own, often pushed by the European Commission.', 'Yet even this growth was not enough, given previous governments‚Äô generous promises of health care and pensions ‚Äì promises made even less tenable by rising life expectancy and falling birth rates.', 'Public debt continued to grow.', 'And the incomes of the moderately educated middle class failed to benefit from deregulation-led growth (though it improved their lot as consumers).', 'The most recent phase of the advanced economies‚Äô frenzied search for growth took different forms.', 'In some countries, most notably the US, a private-sector credit boom created jobs in low-skilled industries like construction, and precipitated a consumption boom as people borrowed against overvalued houses.', 'In other countries, like Greece, as well as under regional administrations in Italy and Spain, a government-led hiring spree created secure jobs for the moderately educated.', 'In this ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù narrative, the advanced countries‚Äô pre-crisis GDP was unsustainable, bolstered by borrowing and unproductive make-work jobs.', 'More borrowed growth ‚Äì the Keynesian formula ‚Äì may create the illusion of normalcy, and may be useful in the immediate aftermath of a deep crisis to calm a panic, but it is no solution to a fundamental growth problem.', 'If this diagnosis is correct, advanced countries need to focus on reviving innovation and productivity growth over the medium term, and on realigning welfare promises with revenue capacity, while alleviating the pain of the truly destitute in the short run.', 'For example, Southern Europe‚Äôs growth potential may consist in deregulating service sectors and reducing employment protection to spur creation of more private-sector jobs for retrenched government workers and unemployed youth.', 'In the US, the imperative is to improve the match between potential jobs and worker skills.', 'People understand better than the government what they need and are acting accordingly.', 'Many women, for example, are leaving low-paying jobs to acquire skills that will open doors to higher-paying positions.', 'Too little government attention has been focused on such issues, partly because payoffs occur beyond electoral horizons, and partly because the effectiveness of government programs has been mixed.', 'Tax reform, however, can provide spur retraining and maintain incentives to work, even while fixing gaping fiscal holes.', 'Three powerful forces, one hopes, will help to create more productive jobs in the future: better use of information and communications technology (and new ways to make it pay), lower-cost energy as alternative sources are harnessed, and sharply rising demand in emerging markets for higher-value-added goods.', 'The advanced countries have a choice.', 'They can act as if all is well, except that their consumers are in a funk, and that ‚Äúanimal spirits‚Äù must be revived through stimulus.', 'Or they can treat the crisis as a wake-up call to fix what debt has papered over in the last few decades.', 'For better or worse, the narrative that persuades these countries‚Äô governments and publics will determine their future ‚Äì and that of the global economy.', '', 'A Crisis of Trust', 'LONDON ‚Äì Public trust in financial institutions, and in the authorities that are supposed to regulate them, was an early casualty of the financial crisis.', 'That is hardly surprising, as previously revered firms revealed that they did not fully understand the very instruments they dealt in or the risks they assumed.', 'It is difficult not to take some private pleasure in this comeuppance for the Masters of the Universe.', 'But, unfortunately, if this loss of trust persists, it could be costly for us all.', 'As Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked, ‚ÄúOur distrust is very expensive.‚Äù', 'The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow made the point in economic terms almost 40 years ago: ‚ÄúIt can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.‚Äù', 'Indeed, much economic research has demonstrated a powerful relationship between the level of trust in a community and its aggregate economic performance.', 'Without mutual trust, economic activity is severely constrained.', 'Even within Europe, there is powerful evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment, particularly through venture capital investment, and are prepared to use more flexible contracts, which are also beneficial for growth and investment.', 'So if it is true that trust in financial institutions ‚Äì and in the governments that oversee them ‚Äì has been damaged by the crisis, we should care a lot, and we should be devising responses which seek to rebuild that trust.', 'In fact, the evidence for a crisis of trust is rather difficult to interpret.', 'In the United Kingdom, recent survey results are ambiguous.', 'Surveys promoted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not diminished much, and that people continue to trust them even more than they do the National Health Service or the BBC.', 'Surveys promoted by the BBC tend to show the reverse.', 'Banks quote statistics to show that they are more trusted than supermarkets, whereas supermarkets cite evidence that the opposite is true, and are expanding into financial services in the belief that the public will trust them more than they trust the banks, which have had to be expensively bailed out by the government.', 'The market will prove one side right before too long.', 'In the United States, there is now a more systematic, independent survey promoted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.', 'Their financial trust index, based on a large-scale survey of financial decision-makers in American households, did show a sharp fall in trust in late 2008 and early 2009, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.', 'That fall in confidence affected banks, the stock market, and the government and its regulators.', 'Furthermore, the survey showed that declining trust was strongly correlated with financial behavior.', 'In other words, if your trust in the market and in the way it is regulated fell sharply, you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks.', 'So falling trust had real economic consequences.', 'Fortunately, the latest survey, published in July this year, shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover, and quite sharply.', 'This has been positive for the stock market.', 'There is also a little more confidence in the government‚Äôs response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year.', 'The latter point, which no doubt reflects the Obama administration‚Äôs attempts to reform the dysfunctional system it inherited, is particularly important, as the sharpest declines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government‚Äôs ability to regulate.', 'It would seem that rebuilding confidence in the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission is economically more important than rebuilding trust in Citibank or AIG.', 'Continuing disputes in Congress about the precise details of reform could, therefore, have an economic cost if a perception that the system will not be overhauled gains ground.', 'All these data are at an aggregate level and reflect average views among voters and investors.', 'Yet we also know that individual views are remarkably heterogeneous.', 'Some people are very trusting of others, and of the firms and institutions with which they do business.', 'Others are congenitally distrustful.', 'Researchers at the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between trust and individuals‚Äô income.', 'A pan-European opinion survey, which has been carried out for many years, allows us to relate the two.', 'It asks simple but powerful questions about how far individuals are inclined to trust those with whom they deal.', 'The data show, intriguingly, that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes.', 'Is that just because low-income people feel that life is unfair and therefore distrust those around them?', 'It would seem not, as it is also true that very trusting people also have lower incomes than the average.', 'In other words, if you diverge markedly from society‚Äôs average level of trust, you are likely to lose out, either because you are so distrustful of others that you miss out on opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial exchange, or because you are so trusting that you leave yourself open to being cheated and abused.', 'When anyone I don‚Äôt know says ‚Äútrust me‚Äù ‚Äì an irritating conversational tic ‚Äì I usually close my wallet.', 'Perhaps most academics, who are at the lower end of the skill and qualification-adjusted income scale, do the same.', 'Maybe we should trust each other more ‚Äì but not too much.', '', 'A Crisis of Understanding', 'NEW HAVEN ‚Äì Few economists predicted the current economic crisis, and there is little agreement among them about its ultimate causes.', 'So, not surprisingly, economists are not in a good position to forecast how quickly it will end, either.', 'Of course, we all know the proximate causes of an economic crisis: people are not spending, because their incomes have fallen, their jobs are insecure, or both.', 'But we can take it a step further back: people‚Äôs income is lower and their jobs are insecure because they were not spending a short time ago ‚Äì and so on, backwards in time, in a repeating feedback loop.', 'It is a vicious circle, but where and why did it start?', 'Why did it worsen?', 'What will reverse it?', 'It is to these questions that economists have been unable to offer clear answers.', 'The state of economic knowledge was just as bad in the Great Depression that followed the 1929 stock market crash.', 'Economists did not predict that event, either.', 'In the 1920‚Äôs, some warned about an overpriced stock market, but they did not predict a decade-long depression affecting the entire economy.', 'Late in the Great Depression, in August 1938, an article by Ralph M. Blagden in The Christian Science Monitor reported an informal set of interviews with US ‚Äúprofessors, banking experts, union leaders, and representatives of business associations and political factions,‚Äù all of whom were given the same question: ‚ÄúWhat causes recessions?‚Äù', 'The multiplicity of answers seemed bewildering, and did not inspire confidence that anyone knew what was causing the deepest crisis of capitalism.', 'The causes given were ‚Äúdistributed widely among government, labor, industry, international politics and policies.‚Äù', 'They included misguided government interference with markets, high income and capital gains taxes, mistaken monetary policy, pressures towards high wages, monopoly, overstocked inventories, uncertainty caused by the reorganization plan for the Supreme Court, rearmament in Europe and fear of war, government encouragement of labor disputes, a savings glut because of population shrinkage, the passing of the frontier, and easy credit before the depression.', 'Although economic theory today is much improved, if we ask people about the cause of the current crisis, we will mostly get the same answers.', 'We would certainly hear some new ones, too: unprecedented real-estate bubbles, a global savings glut, international trade imbalances, exotic financial contracts, sub-prime mortgages, unregulated over-the-counter markets, rating agencies‚Äô errors, compromised real-estate appraisals, and complacency about counterparty risk.', 'More likely than not, many or most of these people would be mostly or partly right, for the economic crisis was caused by a confluence of many factors, the chance co-occurrence of a lot of bad things, which pushed the financial system beyond its breaking point.', 'At that point, the trouble grabbed widespread attention, destroyed public confidence, and set in motion a negative feedback loop.', 'Our attention, after all, is naturally drawn to the worst events. Precisely because the worst events are statistical outliers, their causes are probably multiple.', 'Consider the question of predicting events like the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which killed more than 200,000 people.', 'It captured our attention because it was so bad in terms of lives and property damage.', 'But if one went beyond trying to predict the occurrence of earthquakes to predicting the extent of the damage, one could surely devise a long list of contributing factors ‚Äì including even political, financial, and insurance factors ‚Äì that resembles the list of factors that caused the global economic crisis.', 'Indeed, the crisis knows no end to the list of its causes.', 'For, in a complicated economic system that feeds back on itself in many ways, events that start a vicious cycle might be as seemingly trivial as the proverbial butterfly in the Amazon, which, by flapping its wings, sets off a chain of events that eventually results in a far-away hurricane.', 'Chaos theory in mathematics explains such dependency on remote and seemingly trivial initial conditions, and explains why even the extrapolation of apparently precise planetary motion becomes impossible when taken far enough into the future.', 'Weather forecasters cannot forecast far into the future, either, but at least they have precise mathematical models.', 'Massive parallel computers are programmed to yield numerical solutions of differential equations derived from the theory of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. Scientists appear to know the mechanism that generates weather, even if it is inherently difficult to extrapolate very far.', 'The problem for macroeconomics is that the types of causes mentioned for the current crisis are difficult to systematize.', 'The mathematical models that macroeconomists have may resemble weather models in some respects, but their structural integrity is not guaranteed by anything like a solid, immutable theory.', 'The most important new book about the origins of the economic crisis, Carmen Reinhart‚Äôs and Kenneth Rogoff‚Äôs This Time Is Different, is essentially a summary of lessons learned from virtually every financial crisis in every country in recorded history.', 'But the book is almost entirely non-theoretical.', 'It merely documents recurrent patterns.', 'Unfortunately, in 800 years of financial history, there is only one example of a really massive worldwide contraction, namely the Great Depression of the 1930‚Äôs.', 'So it is hard to know exactly what to expect in the current contraction based on the Reinhart-Rogoff analysis.', 'This leaves us trying to use patterns from past, dissimilar crises to try to infer the likely prognosis for the current crisis.', 'As a result, we simply do not know if the recovery will be solid or disappointing.', '', 'Financing the Next Development Agenda', 'WASHINGTON, DC ‚Äì As the 2015 target date for the Millennium Development Goals approaches, the United Nations is intensifying its efforts to foster debate about what comes next for promotion of development worldwide.', 'The outcome of these discussions will shape policies and investment aimed at spurring GDP growth, strengthening human capital, and promoting more inclusive prosperity.', 'With the global population expected to reach nine billion people by 2050 ‚Äì a significant proportion of whom will reside in developing or underdeveloped countries ‚Äì the international community must improve access to education, health care, and employment opportunities worldwide.', 'Meanwhile, the prospect of a rise in global temperature of more than 2¬∞C (3.6¬∞F) over pre-industrial levels by the end of this century (which would trigger global warming‚Äôs most damaging effects) calls for higher investment in sustainable urbanization, climate-smart agriculture, and social safety nets.', 'Both factors challenge us to define, in the longer term, more sustainable patterns of production and consumption.', 'Governments, civil society, and the private sector must rise to the challenge, cooperating to find and implement creative solutions.', 'But, first, they must anticipate the associated financing requirements, which will soon surpass the current capacities of governments and international donors, and take action now to activate new, reliable sources of financing.', 'To start, governments should design targeted, evidence-based policies and support the development of sound institutions.', 'This would make government services more effective, while helping to catalyze additional development aid from traditional donors and mobilize private-sector resources.', 'In many countries, there is considerable scope for domestic resource mobilization.', 'Broadening the tax base, improving tax administration, and closing gaps in the value-added tax could make a significant difference in lower-income countries, where tax revenues account for only about 10-14% of GDP, compared to 20-30% of GDP in high-income countries.', 'More equitable taxation would have a positive impact on governance, another important tool for mobilizing domestic resources.', 'With improved corporate and public governance and clear transfer-pricing policies, resource-rich countries could shore up their capacity to negotiate fair contracts with extractive industries, balance revenues and expenditures over time, and manage their natural endowments more transparently.', 'Progress in these areas would help governments to channel their spending more effectively toward those who would benefit the most.', 'For example, only 8% of the $409 billion spent on fossil-fuel subsidies in 2010 reached the poorest 20% of the population.', 'A targeted support program could increase substantially the efficiency of spending, freeing up resources for education, health, and poverty eradication.', 'Furthermore, promoting financial deepening and inclusiveness could accelerate private-sector growth, creating more opportunities.', 'Indeed, broader access to financial services would help the estimated 400 million micro, small, and medium-size enterprises in developing countries to prosper, while enabling the 2.5 billion people worldwide who currently lack access to such services to build their assets.', 'A deeper and more efficient financial sector would also reduce transaction costs and facilitate risk management.', 'Local-currency bond markets could help to develop domestic investor bases and mobilize domestic savings to support long-term investments.', 'At the same time, the international community should work to improve the availability and effectiveness of official development assistance.', 'The ODA target of 0.7% of GDP ‚Äì agreed in 2002 at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico ‚Äì should motivate countries to increase their contributions.', 'They can also take steps to make ODA more predictable from year to year.', 'Donors should structure aid to ensure that it supports sound national development policies and programs, rather than their own narrow interests.', 'This is particularly relevant as emerging development partners, especially the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), offer new kinds of aid packages that incorporate investment and non-financial assistance.', 'Private charities, which have been instrumental in promoting innovation in fields such as health care, the environment, and education, could provide valuable insight into channeling aid more effectively.', 'More generally, improving coordination among donors would help to maximize the impact of aid on the ground.', 'While ODA remains an important source of financing for fragile and very-low-income countries, it represents only 7% of net financial flows to developing countries, where foreign direct investment, remittances, long-term debt, and portfolio investment have a larger impact.', 'Donors should leverage aid to ‚Äúgrow the pie‚Äù and to diversify financing sources for the world‚Äôs poorest countries by providing risk guarantees, innovative investment vehicles, debt syndication, and co-financing arrangements.', 'Attracting even a fraction of the assets held by institutional investors, sovereign-wealth funds, and public pension funds could boost

controversial electoral law that favors the country‚Äôs two largest political parties, at the expense of smaller movements.', 'In the United States, professional football players are taking a knee during the national anthem to draw attention to police violence against black people.', 'As different as these examples of public protest are, they have one thing in common: they reflect efforts by ordinary citizens to hold not just their governments, but also companies and other institutions, to account.', 'Such actions, and the right of citizens to organize and participate in them, are essential to a vital democratic society, especially during tumultuous times.', 'There is no doubt that these are tumultuous times.', 'US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have been exchanging incendiary rhetoric, causing many to fear a war on the Korean Peninsula ‚Äì and perhaps a nuclear clash.', 'Large-scale natural disasters ‚Äì hurricanes in Puerto Rico, floods in South Asia, earthquakes in Mexico ‚Äì have brought massive damage and loss of life, and not nearly enough relief aid.', 'Moreover, corruption scandals have erupted far beyond South Africa, including in Brazil and South Korea, yet the links between business and government across the world remain complex, close, and opaque.', 'Far-right populists have made great political strides in Western democracies, most recently in Germany.', 'And, all the while, income inequality continues to grow.', 'Against this background, it is easy to see why ordinary people the world over are feeling increasingly helpless.', 'But it is in the most trying times that we show who we really are.', 'And, from small gestures between neighbors and large private contributions to crisis-relief efforts by major companies, there have been plenty of stories of humanity, individually and institutionally, that offer reason for hope.', 'Indeed, such actions, and the sense of personal accountability they reflect, are what enables our societies to progress and thrive.', 'As we well know, without rules and accountability, government officials and business leaders cannot always be counted on to do the right thing.', 'Moreover, given their influence over policy and the economy, their ethical and moral failures have far-reaching consequences.', 'Yet, while the need to hold government to the highest ethical standards is generally agreed (if not necessarily implemented), many argue that companies should be free to pursue profits at any cost.', 'Like government, however, companies are ultimately run by people in order to serve people; they must therefore also be accountable to people.', 'The key to enforcing this accountability is active citizenship.', 'Taught in schools around the world, from Canada to the United Kingdom, active citizenship means political participation at every level.', 'It is not just a nice idea; it a dynamic and vital concept that individuals, organizations, and institutions should be putting into practice every day.', 'The ethos of active citizenship applies in every sphere.', 'Speaking up about a controversial issue in a board meeting not so long ago, I felt it was important to note that I was speaking not just as a board member, but also as a person.', 'That recognition, however trite it may sound, served as a powerful reminder of a broader lesson: that one must maintain one‚Äôs sense of right and wrong, regardless of the circumstances.', 'Convincing oneself that a decision is purely pragmatic, in order to avoid knotty ethical questions, is not an option.', 'If I, as a person, believe in protecting the environment, or seek in my personal life and business to protect my own security and privacy, I cannot abandon those beliefs in the boardroom in the name of profit.', 'Avoiding active discussion, in an effort not to have to confront the more nuanced ethical implications that might emerge, is no less disingenuous.', 'Being an active and engaged citizen means being authentic and empathetic.', 'It means considering not only what an issue means for us, individually, but also how it affects others.', 'Many have wondered why American football players, who often make millions of dollars per season, are protesting injustice.', 'The reason is simple: active citizenship means standing up ‚Äì or kneeling down ‚Äì for what we believe in, whether it be a government free of corruption or law enforcement free of racism.', 'An ethos of personal integrity and authenticity may seem powerless in the face of unbridled greed and

national budget debates?', 'Jailed swindler Bernie Madoff recently summed up a lot of people‚Äôs feelings about fiscal policy, declaring that ‚Äúthe whole government is a Ponzi scheme.‚Äù', 'Perhaps this was just wishful thinking from a man who will die in prison after his own record-breaking $50 billion pyramid scheme collapsed in 2008.', 'Personally, I suspect Madoff‚Äôs unenviable place in the record books will be secure for quite a while.', 'Still, with many of the world‚Äôs largest governments facing a lethal combination of unsustainable conventional debt, unprecedented old-age pension obligations, and a downshift in growth, one has to wonder what the fiscal plan is.', 'In a new paper, ‚ÄúA Decade of Debt,‚Äù Carmen M. Reinhart and I show that general government debt in the United States, including federal, state, and local debt, has now surpassed the record 120% of GDP reached at the end of World War II.', 'Japan,

'There is a no easy way out.', 'For now, low world interest rates are restraining debt-service costs, but debt levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods, whereas real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates can rise far more quickly, even for rich countries.', 'Debt crises tend to come out of the blue, hitting countries whose debt trajectories simply have no room for error or unplanned adversity.', 'The single most immediate and direct impact of having an independent fiscal policy would be to reign in spending by producing a counterpoint to Panglossian government growth and revenue forecasts.', 'In principle, an independent and respected advisory council could also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and off-balance sheet debts.', 'It is high time to consider novel approaches.', 'Of course, no one simple change will eliminate the huge bias towards deficit spending in most modern political systems.', 'And no one simple change will preclude the risk of future debt and inflation crises.', 'Many countries require sweeping reforms to make their tax systems more efficient and their entitlement programs ‚Äì including their pension schemes ‚Äì more realistic.', 'The recent advent of fiscal advisory councils is a promising institutional start.', 'A number of countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, the US, and Belgium, have long-standing fiscal watchdog agencies, such as the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO).', 'But, while these older institutions have proven enormously useful, they are typically quite constrained.', 'The CBO, for example, is free to issue long-term fiscal projections based on its own best estimates of growth, but is largely forced to accept politically implausible future ‚Äúfixes‚Äù at face value, somewhat neutralizing the potential effectiveness of any critique of deficit policies.', 'To enhance credibility, a number of governments are gingerly moving towards creating fiscal councils with greater independence, often with central banks as a role model.', 'The new vanguard includes councils in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, and Canada.', 'The remit of Sweden‚Äôs fiscal council is particularly broad, giving it a mandate not only to forecast, but also to look more deeply at the motivations and consequences of government policy.', 'In principle, an independent fiscal council could have provided invaluable help during the financial crisis.', 'In the US, such an agency could have weighed in on the costs and benefits of bailout plans, perhaps helping to end congressional paralysis and steeling nerves to give taxpayers more upside risk.', 'It is too much to expect that these new fiscal institutions will become as important or powerful as central banks, at least anytime soon.', 'There is far more consensus over monetary policy than over fiscal policy.', 'And fiscal policy is far more complex and multi-dimensional.', 'Still, the general principle seems like an important step towards fiscal sanity.', 'Of course, fiscal councils by themselves are not enough, no matter how well designed they are.', 'It will remain very tempting for each generation to say, ‚ÄúMy grandchildren will be two or three times richer than I, so who cares if they have to pay some debt?‚Äù', 'Moreover, the political cycle creates a very strong deficit bias, as leaders seek to embellish feelings of economic health and prosperity by raising visible expenditures at the cost of hidden debts and lower long-term investment.', 'To resist these powerful pressures, fiscal councils will need to have their work audited periodically by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund, both to protect their independence and to promote accountability.', 'To be sure, Bernie Madoff may yet be proved right, and his will not turn out to be the biggest Ponzi scheme ever.', 'But greater transparency and a more systematic independent evaluation of

barren policy landscape.', '', 'All Quiet on the Currency Front', 'CAMBRIDGE ‚Äì The term ‚Äúcurrency wars‚Äù is a catchy way of saying ‚Äúcompetitive devaluation.‚Äù', 'In the wake of the sharp fall

of Japan, and other central banks in recent years.', 'The impact of monetary stimulus on a country‚Äôs trade balance ‚Äì and hence on demand for trading partners‚Äô goods ‚Äì is ambiguous: the expenditure-switching effect when the exchange rate responds is counteracted by the expenditure-increasing effect of expansion.', 'Restored income growth means more imports from other countries.', '‚ÄúCurrency wars‚Äù is a more apt description when countries intervene to push down their currencies in deliberate attempts to help their trade balances.', 'But national authorities will and should pursue economic policies that are primarily in their own countries‚Äô interests.', 'International cooperation can be fruitful; but there is little point attempting it if the nature of the spillover effects is not relatively clear to all.', 'Everyone agrees, for example, that spillovers from pollution or tariffs are negative, not positive, externalities.', 'But the case is not as obvious in the case of monetary policy.', 'For example, if unemployment is high and inflation low in the United States, the Fed will naturally ease monetary policy, particularly via low interest rates.', 'If Brazil is in danger of overheating, its central bank will naturally tighten policy, particularly via high interest rates.', 'It is also natural that capital will flow from north to south as a result, causing the Brazilian real to appreciate against the dollar.', 'That is the beauty of floating exchange rates: both countries can choose their own appropriate policies.', 'Given that the two countries‚Äô are in different cyclical positions, such exchange-rate movements signal that the international economic system is working properly.', 'Although the stronger real will help US exporters (other things being equal) and hurt those in Brazil, such ‚Äúcasualties of war‚Äù are not even collateral damage; rather, they are precisely the point.', 'If the goal is to stimulate demand for US goods and dampen demand for Brazilian goods, why shouldn‚Äôt exporters in both countries share in that process, alongside construction and other sectors that are sensitive to interest rates via domestic demand?', 'A more serious dilemma arises if one of the countries is targeting or even fixing the exchange rate, as many Latin American governments did to kill off high inflation in the late 1980‚Äôs and early 1990‚Äôs.', 'Such a country will not necessarily want to abandon a proven exchange-rate regime at the first sign of trouble.', 'Capital controls and sterilization of reserve flows might help to delay the adjustment, but a persistent one-directional capital flow will eventually force the fixed-exchange-rate country to allow either its exchange rate or its money supply to adjust.', 'True, in recent years, a wide array of countries has indicated a preference for weaker currencies as a means of improving their trade balances.', 'It is also true, by definition, that not everyone can depreciate or improve their trade balance at the same time.', 'But that does not necessarily mean that depreciators are guilty of violating any agreements or norms, especially if they have merely maintained a pre-existing exchange-rate regime.', 'Uncoordinated monetary expansion does not even necessarily leave the world in a worse equilibrium.', 'Barry Eichengreen and Jeffrey Sachs have persuasively argued this for the 1930‚Äôs (the opposite of the conventional wisdom regarding beggar-thy-neighbor competitive devaluations).', 'Although all countries could not improve their trade balances simultaneously,

applies today.', 'Brazil‚Äôs finance minister, Guido Mantega, coined the term ‚Äúcurrency wars‚Äù in response to American efforts to enlist Brazil and other competitors of China in a campaign for a stronger renminbi.', 'But the accusation against the US is especially misplaced.', 'US monetary expansion contributed to global monetary expansion at a time when, on average, it was needed.', 'US authorities have not intervened in the foreign-exchange market or talked down the dollar, and currency depreciation was not the Fed‚Äôs goal when deciding to implement its quantitative-easing policy.', 'Japan comes a little closer to qualifying as a currency warrior, because members of Shinzo Abe‚Äôs government were initially foolish enough to mention yen depreciation as an explicit goal.', 'China qualifies in one important respect: the renminbi was substantially undervalued by most measures from 2004 to 2009 (less so now).', 'But countries have a right to opt for fixed exchange rates.', 'Continuing an existing regime, as China was doing, does not sound very much like ‚Äúmanipulation.‚Äù', 'True, renminbi appreciation was probably in China‚Äôs interest.', 'It would have been reasonable, beginning in 2004, for those worried about current-account imbalances to propose that China voluntarily allow some appreciation in exchange for, say, the US putting its fiscal house in

warning of sustained economic stagnation in the advanced economies.', 'But, while many reject his suggestion of a secular trend, the data support him.', 'Yes, economic growth has picked up in the United States and the United Kingdom, while the eurozone economy is no longer contracting and Japan shows some signs of responding to ‚ÄúAbenomics.‚Äù', 'But the global recovery remains extremely weak, with most advanced economies still performing at 10-15% below pre-crisis growth trends.', 'It is not difficult to see why the recovery has been anemic.', 'Excessive private-debt creation before the crisis and subsequent attempts at deleveraging have weakened demand considerably.', 'While fiscal deficits can help to offset deficient demand, they also result in rising public debt.', 'Leverage has not gone away; it has simply shifted to the public sector ‚Äì creating a debt overhang that may last for many years, or even decades.', 'Eliminating it will likely require significant debt write-offs or permanent monetization.', 'But, as Summers noted, the party that preceded this severe post-crisis hangover was not, in terms of actual growth, all that exuberant.', 'Credit volumes and asset prices soared, but labor markets did not overheat, real earnings remained flat in many advanced economies, and inflation rates were remarkably stable.', 'Nominal demand grew at roughly 5% annually, despite annual credit growth of 10% or more.', 'Today, the same pattern is unfolding in many emerging economies ‚Äì most notably, China.', 'With credit growth far outpacing nominal GDP growth, leverage is increasing.', 'And it seems that the rising credit intensity of GDP growth (the amount of new credit required to generate a unit of output) is needed to ensure that economic performance remains in line with potential.', 'This implies a serious dilemma: while rising leverage is apparently essential, it inevitably leads to crisis and recession.', 'Against this background, policymakers must consider whether rapid credit growth is really necessary, and whether there are any alternatives ‚Äì a question that modern economics has so far largely ignored.', 'In fact, much credit growth is not critical to economic growth, because it does not play a direct role in financing consumption or investment.', 'Economics textbooks often describe how households deposit money in banks, which lend to businesses to finance capital investment.', 'But, in advanced economies ‚Äì and increasingly in emerging economies ‚Äì this story is largely fictional, because such lending accounts for only a small share of the total.', 'Instead, a large part of bank lending finances the purchase of existing assets, particularly commercial or residential real estate, the prices of which primarily reflect the value of the underlying land.', 'Such existing-asset finance does not directly stimulate investment or consumption.', 'But it does drive up asset prices, causing lenders and borrowers to believe that even more credit growth is both safe and desirable.', 'Lending to finance existing assets, primarily in real-estate markets, can thus play an asymmetric role in the real economy.', 'While it has little impact on demand, output, and prices during the boom, it results in debt overhang, deleveraging, and depressed demand in the post-crisis period.', 'In this context, policymakers should distinguish between categories of debt.', 'For example, they could impose higher capital requirements on real-estate lending or introduce direct borrower constraints like limits on loan-to-value or loan-to-income ratios.', 'Such policies would help to reduce the credit intensity of growth, thereby curbing the threat to long-term economic stability.', 'Nonetheless, the problem of deficient demand might persist.', 'Even though such lending does not stimulate demand for newly produced goods and services directly, it may do so indirectly by generating unsustainable wealth effects (driving people to spend more because they feel richer).', 'Constraining the lending that drives up real-estate prices could lead to lower nominal demand.', 'Curtailing demand for this category of credit would lower the real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate.', 'But we cannot assume that this would offset the deflationary impact of reduced wealth effects.', 'Even before the crisis, real long-term interest rates were on a clear downward trajectory, with 20-year index-linked yields falling from almost 4% in 1990 to below 2% by 2007.', 'Whether even lower interest rates would have stimulated significant additional investment is unclear.', 'The fundamental question therefore remains: Is there something about modern economies that makes adequate demand growth impossible without damaging credit growth?', 'Rising inequality is one driver of this apparent ‚Äúneed for credit.‚Äù', 'Wealthier people have a higher marginal propensity to save than poorer people.', 'As the rich get richer, consumption growth may decline, unless the financial system uses their savings to lend to the relatively poor.', 'But much of this debt may prove unsustainable.', 'As Raghuram Rajan pointed out in his book Fault Lines, the US subprime-mortgage boom and bust owed much to pitiably slow growth in lower-income Americans‚Äô real earnings over the last three decades.', 'Global imbalances also contribute to rising debt risk.', 'If current-account surpluses are not matched by rising equity claims against the rest of the world ‚Äì whether through corporate foreign direct investment or household-equity investments in other countries ‚Äì they inevitably result in debt claims, increasing public or private debt liabilities in deficit countries.', 'Some of those debt claims will likely prove unsustainable, and all of them may contribute to post-crisis debt-overhang effects.', 'A more stable growth model requires less of the ‚Äúwrong type of debt‚Äù ‚Äì that is, debt that finances purchases of existing assets, supports consumption without addressing the drivers of inequality, or results from unsustainable global imbalances.', 'Without targeted policies aimed at limiting such debt, the world economy risks secular stagnation or further cycles of instability and crisis.', 'Read More from \"Germany versus the Euro?\"', '', 'In Praise of Fragmentation', 'LONDON ‚Äì Emerging markets are back in the spotlight.', 'Investors and banks are suddenly unwilling to finance current-account deficits with short-term debt.', 'South Africa, for example, has had to increase interest

decades of rapid growth.', 'Likewise, most cross-country studies have found no evidence that capital-account liberalization is good for growth.', 'As the economist Jagdish Bhagwati pointed out 16 years ago in his article ‚ÄúThe Capital Myth,‚Äù there are fundamental differences between trade in widgets and trade in dollars.', 'The case for liberalizing trade in goods and services is strong;

World War I, capital flowed in one direction: from rich countries with excess savings, such as the United Kingdom, to countries like Australia or Argentina, whose investment needs exceeded domestic savings.', 'But in today‚Äôs world, net capital flows are often from relatively poor countries to rich countries.', 'Huge two-way gross capital flows are driven by transient changes in perception, with carry-trade opportunities (borrowing in low-yielding currencies to finance lending in high-yielding ones) replacing long-term capital investment.', 'Moreover, capital inflows frequently finance consumption or unsustainable real-estate booms.', 'And yet, despite the growing evidence to the contrary, the assumption that all capital flows are beneficial has proved remarkably resilient.', 'That reflects the power not only of vested interests but also of established ideas.', 'Empirical falsification of a prevailing orthodoxy is disturbing.', 'Even economists who find no evidence that capital-account liberalization boosts growth often feel obliged to stress that ‚Äúfurther analysis‚Äù might at last reveal the benefits that free-market theory suggests must exist.', 'It is time to stop looking for these non-existent benefits, and to distinguish among different categories of capital flows.', 'Some are valuable, but some are potentially harmful.', 'Foreign direct investment (FDI), for example, can aid growth, because it is long term, involves investment in the real economy, and is often accompanied by technology or skill transfers.', 'Equity portfolio investment may involve price volatility as ownership positions change, but at least it implies a permanent commitment of capital to a business enterprise.', 'Long-term debt finance of real capital investment can play a useful role as well.', 'By contrast, short-term capital flows, particularly if provided by banks that are themselves relying on short-term funding, can create instability risks, while bringing few benefits.', 'What is less clear is the best policy response.', 'Capital controls are invariably porous, and we cannot gain the benefits of free trade and FDI without creating some opportunities for short-term investor positioning.', 'China has not liberalized its capital account, but short-term inflows are now driving stronger upward pressure on the renminbi (and larger offsetting reserve accumulation by the People‚Äôs Bank of China) than can be explained by the current-account surplus and FDI flows.', 'A case can thus be made for capital-account liberalization that is based on the impossibility of effective control, not on any supposed benefits.', 'But while perfect policy is unattainable, partly effective controls can still play a useful role if targeted at the interface between short-term inflows and domestic credit cycles.', 'After all, capital inflows cause the greatest harm when they drive rapid increases in credit-financed consumption or real-estate speculation.', 'The required policy response should integrate domestic financial regulation with capital-account management.', 'Tax instruments and reserve requirements that put sand in the wheels of short-term capital inflows should be combined with strong countercyclical measures, such as additional capital requirements, to slow domestic credit creation.', 'The effectiveness of such measures can be undermined if global banks operate in emerging countries in branch form, providing domestic credit financed by global funding pools.', 'But this danger can be countered by requiring banks to operate as legally incorporated subsidiaries, with locally regulated capital and liquidity reserves, and strong regulatory limits on the maturity of their funding.', 'Such requirements would not prevent useful capital flows: global banking groups could invest equity in emerging markets and fund their subsidiaries‚Äô balance sheets with long-term debt.', 'In banking, as in other sectors, investment that combines long-term commitment with skill transfer can be highly beneficial, which implies that foreign banks should be free to compete on the same basis as domestic banks.', 'Neither mandatory subsidiarization nor tax- or regulation-based capital controls will solve all of the problems.', 'But, taken together, they can stem the volatility implied by short-term flows and help to smooth out domestic credit cycles.', 'Much of the financial industry resists such measures, as do the many economists who remain wedded to the old orthodoxy.', 'Renewed capital controls, they claim, would ‚Äúfragment‚Äù the global financial market, undermining its ability to allocate capital efficiently.', 'In the past, policymakers have been at pains to stress that no such fragmentation will be allowed.', 'But we need to be blunt: Free flows of short-term debt can result in capital misallocation and harmful instability.', 'When it comes to global capital markets, fragmentation can be a good thing.', '', 'The High-Tech, High-Touch Economy', 'LONDON ‚Äì A recent report revealed that the five richest families in Britain are worth more than the country‚Äôs poorest 20% combined.', 'Some of the wealth comes from new business ventures; but two of the five are a duke and an earl whose ancestors owned the fields across which London expanded in the nineteenth century.', 'Urban land wealth is not just a London phenomenon.', 'As Thomas Piketty‚Äôs recent book Capital in the Twenty-First Century shows, accumulated wealth has grown rapidly relative to income across the advanced economies over the last 40 years.', 'In many countries, the majority of that wealth ‚Äì and the lion‚Äôs share of the increase ‚Äì is accounted for by housing and commercial real estate, and most of that wealth resides not in the value of the buildings, but in the value of the urban land on which it sits.', 'That might seem odd.', 'Though we live in the hi-tech virtual world of the Internet, the value of the most physical thing ‚Äì land ‚Äì is rising relentlessly.', 'But there is no contradiction: The price of land is rising because of rapid technological progress.', 'In an age of information and communication technology (ICT), it is inevitable that we value what an ICT-intensive economy cannot create.', 'ICT has already delivered remarkable new products and services; but, as MIT‚Äôs Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue persuasively in their recent book The Second Machine Age, the really dramatic changes are yet to come, with robots and software bound to automate out of existence a huge number of jobs.', 'One consequence is the striking phenomenon of huge wealth creation with very little labor input.', 'Facebook has an equity valuation of $170 billion but employs only around 6,000 people.', 'The investment that went into building the software that runs it entailed no more than around 5,000 software engineer man-years.', 'This remarkable technology has helped to deliver increasing average incomes and will continue to do so.', 'But the distribution of that bounty has been very unequal.', 'The lion‚Äôs share of the growth has gone to the top half, the top 10%, or even the top 1% of the population.', 'As the better off become richer, however, much of their rising income will not be spent on ICT-intensive goods and services.', 'There is a limit to how many iPads and smart phones one can need, and their price continues to plummet.', 'Instead, an increasing share of consumer expenditure is devoted to buying goods and services that are rich in fashion, design, and subjective brand values, and to competing for ownership of location-specific real estate.', 'But if the land on which the desired houses and apartments sit is in limited supply, the inevitable consequence is rising prices.', 'Urban land is therefore rising in value ‚Äì in London, New York, Shanghai, and many other cities ‚Äì partly because of consumer demand.', 'But its rising value also makes it an attractive asset class for investors, because further price increases are expected.', 'Moreover, returns on real estate have been swollen by the dramatic fall in interest rates over the last 25 years, a decline that was far advanced even before the 2008 financial crisis.', 'The cause of those low interest rates is debated; but one probable factor is the reduced cost of business investment in hardware and software-based ‚Äúmachines.‚Äù', 'If you can build a $170 billion company with just 5,000 software engineer man-years, you don‚Äôt need to borrow much money.', 'The fact that technology is so powerful not only makes physical land more valuable; it also means that future employment growth will be concentrated among the jobs that cannot be automated, particularly in services, which have to be delivered physically.', 'The US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that among the most rapidly growing occupational categories over the next ten years will be ‚Äúhealthcare support occupations‚Äù (nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants) and ‚Äúfood preparation and serving workers‚Äù ‚Äì that is, overwhelmingly low-wage jobs.', 'In short, ICT creates an economy that is both ‚Äúhi-tech‚Äù and ‚Äúhi-touch‚Äù ‚Äì a world of robots and apps, but also of fashion, design, land, and face-to-face services.', 'This economy is the result of our remarkable ability to solve the problem of production and automate away the need for continual labor.', 'But it is an economy that is likely to suffer two adverse side effects.', 'First, it may be inherently unstable, because the more that wealth resides in real estate, the more the financial system will provide leverage to support real-estate speculation, which has been at the heart of all of the world‚Äôs worst financial crises.', 'Major changes in financial and monetary policy, going far beyond those introduced in response to the 2008 crisis, are required to contain this danger.', 'Second, unless we deliberately design policies that encourage and sustain inclusive growth, a highly unequal society is virtually inevitable, with rising land values and wealth magnifying the effects of the unequal income distribution that ICT produces directly.', 'Indeed, the modern economy may resemble that of the eighteenth century, when the land owned by the Duke of Westminster and the Earl of Cadogan was still just fields to the west of London, more than the middle-class societies in which most developed countries‚Äô citizens‚Äô grew up.', '', 'The Trade Delusion', 'LONDON ‚Äì Since 2008, global trade has grown slightly more slowly than global GDP.', 'The Doha Round of World Trade Organization negotiations ended in failure.', 'Transatlantic and transpacific trade negotiations are progressing slowly, held back by the resistance of special interests.', 'But, though many experts fear that protectionism is undermining globalization, threatening to impede global economic growth, slower growth in global trade may be inevitable, and trade liberalization is decreasingly important.', 'To be sure, for 65 years, rapid trade growth has played a vital role in economic development, with average advanced-economy industrial tariffs plummeting from more than 30% to below 5%.', 'The creation of Europe‚Äôs single market facilitated increased intra-European trade.', 'Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan achieved rapid economic catch-up on the basis of export-led growth.', 'China has followed the same path over the last 30 years.', 'Trade grew about twice as fast as global output from 1990 to 2008.', 'But there is no reason why trade should grow faster than GDP forever.', 'Indeed, even if there were no trade barriers at all, trade might grow significantly more slowly than GDP in some periods.', 'Several factors make it possible that we are entering such a period.', 'For starters, there is the changing pattern of consumption in the advanced economies.', 'Richer people spend an increasing share of their income on services that are either impossible to trade (for example, restaurant meals) or difficult to trade (such as health services).', 'Non-tradable sectors tend to account for a growing share of employment and economic activity.', 'For several decades, that tendency has been offset by ever more intensive trading of tradable goods, often passing through many countries in complex supply chains.', 'In the future, however, the shift to non-tradable consumption may dominate.', 'Indeed, trade intensity may decline even for manufactured goods.', 'Trade is partly driven by differences in labor costs.', 'China‚Äôs dramatic manufacturing growth reflected low wages up to now.', 'But as real wages in China and other emerging economies grow, incentives for trade will decline.', 'The more that global incomes converge, the less trade there may be.', 'In addition, as the economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee of MIT have argued in their book The Second Machine Age, rapid advances in information technology may enable increasingly extensive automation.', 'Some manufacturing activities, though few jobs, may well return to developed countries, as the advantages of proximity to customers and lower transport costs outweigh decreasingly important differences in labor costs.', 'Global trade as a share of GDP may therefore decline, but without adverse consequences for global economic growth.', 'Rising productivity does not require relentlessly increasing trade intensity.', 'Earth, after all, does not trade with other planets, yet its economy still grows.', 'Optimal trade intensity depends on many factors ‚Äì such as relative labor costs, transport costs, productivity levels, and economy-of-scale effects.', 'Trends in these factors might make reduced trade intensity not only inevitable but desirable.', 'Even if that is true, international trade will still play a vital role, and preventing any reversal of past trade liberalization is essential.', 'But further trade liberalization is bound to be of declining importance to economic growth.', 'With industrial tariffs already dramatically reduced most potential benefits of trade liberalization have already been grasped.', 'Estimates of the benefits of further trade liberalization are often surprisingly low ‚Äì no more than a few percentage points of global GDP.', 'That is small compared to the cost of the 2008 financial crisis, which has left output in several advanced economies 10-15% below pre-crisis trend levels.', 'It is small, too, compared to the difference in economic performance between successful catch-up countries ‚Äì such as China ‚Äì and other countries that have enjoyed the same access to global markets but have performed less well for other reasons.', 'The main reason for slow progress in trade negotiations is not increasing protectionism; it is the fact that further liberalization entails complex trade-offs no longer offset by very large potential benefits.', 'The Doha Round‚Äôs failure has been decried as a setback for developing countries.', 'And some liberalization ‚Äì say, of advanced economies‚Äô cotton imports ‚Äì would undoubtedly benefit some low-income economies.', 'But full trade liberalization would have a complex impact on the least developed economies, some of which would benefit only if compensated for the loss of the preferential access to advanced-economy markets that they currently enjoy.', 'This implies that further progress in trade liberalization will be slow.', 'But slow progress is a far less important challenge to growth prospects than the debt overhang in developed economies, or infrastructure and educational deficiencies in many developing economies.', 'That reality often goes unacknowledged.', 'The importance of past trade liberalization has left the global policy establishment with a bias toward assuming that further liberalization would bring similar benefits.', 'But while the potential global benefits of trade liberalization have declined, reduced trade intensity might still impede economic development in some countries.', 'Only a handful of economies over the last 60 years have fully caught up to advanced-economy living standards, and all relied on export-led growth to drive productivity and job creation in manufacturing.', 'Relying solely on that model will be more difficult in the future.', 'China is so big that it must develop domestic drivers of growth at an earlier stage of development than did Japan, Taiwan, or South Korea; as a result, its exports will inevitably decline (relative to GDP).', 'Meanwhile, for some low-income countries, increased manufacturing and service-sector automation of the sort described by Brynjolfsson and McAfee, whether within advanced economies or within China‚Äôs established industrial clusters, will make the path to middle- and high-income status more difficult to achieve.', 'That poses important challenges for development policy, which further trade liberalization can alleviate only marginally.', '', 'Facing Reality in the Eurozone', 'LONDON ‚Äì European Central Bank President Mario Draghi‚Äôs recent speech at the annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, has excited great interest, but the implication of his remarks is even more startling than many initially recognized.', 'If a eurozone breakup is to be avoided, escaping from continued recession will require increased fiscal deficits financed with ECB money.', 'The only question is how openly that reality will be admitted.', 'The latest economic data have forced eurozone policymakers to face the severe deflationary risks that have been apparent for at least two years.', 'Inflation is stuck far below the ECB‚Äôs 2% annual target, and GDP growth has ground to a halt.', 'Without strong policy action, the eurozone, like Japan since the 1990s, faces a lost decade or two of painfully slow growth.', 'Until last month, growing concern provoked unconvincing policy proposals.', 'Jens Weidmann provided the novel spectacle of a Bundesbank president calling for higher wages.', 'But wage growth will not occur without policy stimulus.', 'Draghi sought to talk down the euro exchange rate to improve competitiveness.', 'But Japan and China also want competitive exchange rates to spur export growth, and the eurozone already runs a current-account surplus.', 'The German model of export-led growth cannot work for the eurozone as a whole.', 'Structural reform is certainly needed in some countries to increase long-term growth potential; but the impact of structural reform on short-term growth is often negative.', 'The eurozone needs higher domestic demand to escape the debt overhang left behind by pre-crisis excess.', 'In countries such as Spain and Ireland, private debts grew to unsustainable levels.', 'In others, such as Greece and Italy, public debt also was too high.', 'Household consumption, business investment, and public expenditure have all been cut in an attempt to pay down debt.', 'But simultaneous public and private deleveraging is bound to depress demand and growth.', 'Faced with private deleveraging in the 1990s, Japan avoided an even deeper depression only by running large public deficits.', 'That is why eurozone fiscal austerity has become self-defeating.', 'The more aggressively the Italian government, for example, cuts expenditure or increases taxation, the more its public-debt burden ‚Äì already above 130% of GDP ‚Äì will likely grow to unsustainable levels.', 'Until two weeks ago, eurozone policymakers denied this reality.', 'On August 22, at Jackson Hole, Draghi admitted it.', 'Without higher aggregate demand, he argued, structural reform could be ineffective; and higher demand requires fiscal stimulus alongside expansionary monetary policy.', 'The Italian economists Francesco Giavazzi and Guido Tabellini have spelled out what coordinated fiscal and monetary policy could mean.', 'They propose tax cuts equal to 5% of GDP for 3-4 years in all eurozone countries, financed by very long-term public debt, all of which the ECB should buy.', 'They argue that ECB quantitative easing alone, with no fiscal relaxation, would be ineffective.', 'Giavazzi and Tabellini‚Äôs proposals may entail too large a stimulus.', 'But they also highlight a crucial question: How does quantitative easing stimulate an economy?', 'The Bank of England has presented QE as a purely monetary policy tool that sustains economic growth in the face of necessary and desirable fiscal consolidation.', 'It works, the BoE has argued, by reducing medium-term interest rates, increasing asset prices, and inducing shifts in investor preferences that indirectly stimulate investment and thus demand.', 'The US Federal Reserve‚Äôs position has been more ambiguous.', 'Fed Vice-Chairman Stanley Fischer, like former Chairman Ben Bernanke, has stressed that premature fiscal consolidation can hold back post-crisis recovery.', 'Thus, the Fed has implicitly viewed QE in part as a tool to ensure that rising bond yields do not offset the beneficial impact of large deficits.', 'The Fed‚Äôs position is more persuasive.', 'Fiscal stimulus has a direct and powerful impact on demand.', 'In Milton Friedman‚Äôs words, it enters directly into ‚Äúthe current income stream.‚Äù', 'Monetary stimulus alone is less direct, takes longer, and risks causing adverse side effects.', 'Continued low interest rates allow unsuccessful companies to struggle on, slowing productivity growth; asset-price rises exacerbate inequality; and monetary stimulus works only by reigniting the private credit growth that generated the debt overhang in the first place.', 'But if fiscal stimulus must be facilitated by central bank bond purchases to prevent yield increases and to assuage fears about debt sustainability, doesn‚Äôt that amount to monetary financing of fiscal deficits?', 'The answer depends on whether the purchases prove permanent.', 'In Japan, where the central bank now owns government bonds worth 35% of GDP (a level that is rising fast), they undoubtedly will.', 'There is no credible scenario in which Japan can generate fiscal surpluses large enough to repay its accumulated debt: a significant proportion will remain permanently on the Bank of Japan‚Äôs balance sheet.', 'Likewise, if Giavazzi and Tabellini‚Äôs proposal were adopted, the result would almost certainly be some permanent increase in the ECB‚Äôs balance sheet.', 'Should we admit that possibility explicitly in advance?', 'The argument in favor is that failure to do so would raise fears about how increased public debt would ever be repaid, or about how the ECB would ‚Äúexit‚Äù from a swollen balance sheet, in turn undermining the stimulative impact of fiscal and monetary coordination.', 'The argument against is moral hazard: If we admit that modest ECB-financed deficits are possible and appropriate now, what will prevent politicians and electorates from demanding large and inflationary ECB-financed deficits on other occasions?', 'The political risks are certainly great.', 'Optimal policy may therefore require a non-transparent fudge; monetary and fiscal ‚Äúcoordination‚Äù might mean, after the fact, permanent monetary finance, but without ever openly admitting that possibility.', 'But, fudge or not, Draghi has moved the debate forward dramatically.', 'Without a greater role for fiscal policy, the eurozone will face either continued slow growth or an eventual breakup.', '', 'When Fewer Is Better', 'LONDON ‚Äì Is a shrinking population always a bad thing?', 'Judging by the lamentations of some economists and policymakers in the advanced economies, where people are living longer and birth rates have fallen below replacement levels, one certainly might think so.', 'In fact, the benefits of demographic stability ‚Äì or even slight decline ‚Äì outweigh any adverse effects.', 'To be sure, an aging population poses obvious challenges for pension systems.', 'And, as economists like Paul Krugman have suggested, it could also mean that advanced economies face not only a slow recovery, but also the danger of ‚Äúsecular stagnation.‚Äù', 'With slower population growth, the need to invest in capital stock diminishes.', 'Meanwhile, people planning for longer retirements may save more to ensure adequate pensions.', 'If these savings exceed investment needs, they could lead to inadequate aggregate demand, depressing economic growth.', 'But the policy challenges associated with these demographic shifts are manageable.', 'And, perhaps more important, the benefits of increased longevity and reduced fertility are considerable.', 'Rising life expectancy is the welcome product of medical and economic progress, and additional increases are almost certain.', 'Indeed, the average life expectancy for children born in prosperous countries could soon exceed 100.', 'That implies an ever-rising ratio of those over 65 to younger cohorts.', 'But as long as average retirement ages rise to keep stable the proportions of life spent in work and in retirement, the fact that working and retirement years are growing at equal rates has no adverse economic effect.', 'There is, moreover, strong evidence that rising longevity can mean more years of healthy active life, not unhealthy dependency.', 'Only bad policies, such as the recent German commitment to reduce retirement ages, can turn longer lives into an economic problem.', 'Declining fertility, including in some lower- and middle-income countries, such as Iran and Brazil, also reflects hugely positive social developments ‚Äì particularly the empowerment of women.', 'Wherever women have the right to an education and to choose how many children to have, fertility rates fall to or slightly below replacement levels.', 'Falling birth rates challenge pension systems more than rising longevity, because they imply a rising old-age dependency ratio even if retirement ages increase in line with life expectancy.', 'But as long as birth rates are only slightly below replacement level, pension systems‚Äô sustainability can be ensured by means of affordable increases in contribution rates.', 'And lower birth rates deliver the offsetting benefit of lower child dependency ratios, reducing education costs or enabling increased investment in education per child.', 'Slower population growth might also reduce the increase in wealth-to-income ratios, and the resulting increase in inequality that Thomas Piketty recently highlighted.', 'In many countries, the increase results primarily from the rise in real-estate prices relative to income, as more prosperous people devote a growing share of their income to purchasing property in desirable locations.', 'Continued population growth would intensify competition for such ‚Äúpositional goods,‚Äù which are not easily supplied in greater volume.', 'A stable population, or actual decline, would reduce their importance somewhat.', 'It would also make it easier to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions at an acceptable cost, and to preserve and enhance local environmental quality, which people increasingly value as their incomes rise.', 'For today‚Äôs advanced economies, a stable or slightly declining population would likely be optimal for human welfare.', 'For the world as a whole, it is a desirable goal.', 'But it is also a distant goal.', 'Indeed, population decline in the advanced countries remains far less of a problem than rapid population growth in many developing countries.', 'The United Nations‚Äô medium fertility scenario projects that the world‚Äôs population will rise from seven billion today to ten billion by 2050.', 'Nigeria‚Äôs population could rise from 123 million in 2000 to 440 million by 2050, while Yemen‚Äôs could grow from 18 million to 42 million.', 'High fertility rates in many countries are partly a consequence of low income.', 'But causation also runs the other way.', 'High fertility rates stymie prospects for economic growth, because excessively rapid population growth makes it impossible to accumulate per capita stocks of physical and human capital at the pace required to drive rapid income gains.', 'That said, efforts to control population growth through measures like China‚Äôs compulsory one-child policy are both morally abhorrent and unnecessary.', 'As examples like Iran show, even low-income countries can achieve dramatic fertility reductions simply by providing choice and education.', 'But that does not change the fact that China‚Äôs rapid fertility decline played a major role in its extraordinary economic breakthrough.', 'Facile commentary often suggests the opposite: countries with high fertility rates supposedly enjoy the demographic dividend of a rapidly rising and youthful population.', 'But, beyond some rate of population growth, jobs cannot be created fast enough to absorb the growing workforce.', 'Almost all countries with fertility rates well above replacement levels face economically and socially harmful youth-unemployment rates.', 'Political instability in the Middle East has many causes, but among them is the lack of jobs for young people, especially young men.', 'Yes, demographic slowdown may, as Krugman and others have argued, increase the risk of deficient demand and below-potential growth.', 'But if the problem is inadequate demand, the danger can be averted.', 'Governments and central banks can always create additional nominal demand if they are willing to use all of the policy tools available to them, such as debt- or money-financed public investment.', 'And if there are underused resources, additional real growth will result.', 'If aging populations lead to secular stagnation, the cause will be deficient policies.', 'By contrast, the problems created by excessively rapid population growth are rooted in real and unavoidable constraints.', 'The manageable challenges created by rising life expectancy and lower birth rates should not be allowed to obscure the huge benefits of greater longevity and population stabilization.', 'And it certainly should not blind us to the adverse economic and social consequences of rapid population growth.', '', 'Rethinking the Monetization Taboo', 'LONDON ‚Äì Now that the pace of the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs ‚Äútapering‚Äù of its asset-purchase program has been debated to death, attention will increasingly turn to prospects for interest-rate increases.', 'But another question looms: How will central banks achieve a final ‚Äúexit‚Äù from unconventional monetary policy and return balance sheets swollen by unconventional monetary policy to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù levels?', 'To many, a larger issue needs to be addressed.', 'The Fed‚Äôs tapering merely slows the growth of its balance sheet.', 'The authorities would still have to sell $3 trillion of bonds to return to the pre-crisis status quo.', 'The rarely admitted truth, however, is that there is no need for central banks‚Äô balance sheets to shrink.', 'They could stay permanently larger; and, for some countries, permanently bigger central-bank balance sheets will help reduce public-debt burdens.', 'As a recent IMF paper by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff illustrates, advanced economies face debt burdens that cannot be reduced simply through a mix of austerity, forbearance, and growth.', 'But if a central bank owns the debt of its own government, no net public liability exists.', 'The government owns the central bank, so the debt is to itself, and the interest expense comes back to the government as the central bank‚Äôs profit.', 'If central bank holdings of government debt were converted into non-interest-bearing perpetual obligations, nothing substantive would change, but it would become obvious that some previously issued public debt did not need to be repaid.', 'This amounts to ‚Äúhelicopter money‚Äù after the fact.', 'In 2003, then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued that Japan, facing deflation, should increase public expenditure or cut taxes, funding the operation by printing money rather than issuing bonds.', 'This, he argued, was bound to increase national income, because the direct stimulative effect would not be offset by concern about future debt burdens.', 'His advice was not followed; large Japanese deficits were in fact bond-financed.', 'But the debts held by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could still be written off.', 'In Japan‚Äôs case, this would reduce government debt by an amount equal to more than 40% of GDP today, and around 60% if implemented after the bond purchases planned for 2014.', 'Objections focus on two risks: central-bank losses and excessive inflation.', 'But both of these outcomes can be avoided.', 'Central banks have bought government bonds with money on which they currently pay zero or very low interest rates.', 'So, as interest rates rise, central banks might face costs exceeding their income.', 'But central banks can choose to pay zero interest on a portion of the reserves that commercial banks hold with them, even when they increase the policy interest rate.', 'And they can require commercial banks to hold zero-interest reserves at the central bank equal to a defined proportion of their loans, thus preventing inflationary growth of private credit and money.', 'Permanent monetization of government debts is undoubtedly technically possible.', 'Whether it is desirable depends on the outlook for inflation.', 'Where inflation is returning to target levels, debt monetization could be unnecessarily and dangerously stimulative.', 'Central-bank bond sales, while certainly not inevitable, may be appropriate.', 'But if deflation is the danger, permanent monetization may be the best policy.', 'I predict that Japan will, in effect, permanently monetize some government debt.', 'After two decades of low growth and deflation, Japanese gross public debt is now above 240% of GDP (and above 140% of GDP on a net basis); and, with the fiscal deficit at 9.5% of GDP, the debt burden continues to increase.', 'According to the IMF, to reduce its net public debt to 80% of GDP by 2030, Japan would have to turn today‚Äôs 8.6% primary budget deficit (the balance excluding interest payments) into a 6.7% primary surplus by 2020 and maintain such surpluses continuously until 2030.', 'That will not happen, and any attempt to reach that target would drive Japan into a severe depression.', 'But the government does not need to repay the ¬•140 trillion ($1.4 trillion) of its debt that the BoJ already owns.', 'The BoJ will continue to increase its balance sheet until it achieves its 2% inflation target.', 'Thereafter, its balance sheet may stabilize in absolute yen terms and fall slowly as a percentage of GDP, but its absolute size will probably never decrease ‚Äì a likelihood that should cause no concern.', 'It is precisely what happened to the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet after its wartime and postwar buying of US government bonds came to an end in 1951.', 'Even as permanent monetization occurs, however, the truth may be obfuscated.', 'If government bond repayments to the BoJ continued, but were always offset by new BoJ bond purchases, and if the BoJ kept the interest rate on reserves at zero, the net effect would be the same as a debt write-off, but the fiction of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù central-bank operations could be maintained.', 'Central banks can monetize debt while pretending not to.', 'That pretense may reflect a useful taboo: if we overtly recognize that debt write-off/monetization is possible, politicians might want to do it all the time and in excess, not just in circumstances that make it appropriate.', 'The historical experience of Weimar Germany, or that of Zimbabwe today, illustrates the danger.', 'As a result, even when permanent monetization occurs ‚Äì as it almost certainly will in Japan and possibly elsewhere ‚Äì it may remain forever the policy that dare not speak its name.', 'Such reticence may serve a useful purpose.', 'But it must not blind central banks and governments to the full range of policy tools available to address today‚Äôs severe debt overhangs.', '', 'The Perils of Financial Freedom', 'LONDON ‚Äì Back in 2007, China‚Äôs then-prime minister, Wen Jiabao, famously described his country‚Äôs economy as ‚Äúunstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable.‚Äù', 'Today, the imbalance remains, with the economy too focused on investment and too dependent on credit.', 'China‚Äôs current leadership is committed to building a more balanced model, and believes that the market must play a ‚Äúdecisive role‚Äù in achieving that.', 'But, while stronger market discipline is needed in some areas, Chinese officials should be under no illusion that free markets are a panacea for the financial sector.', 'Indeed, China‚Äôs current economic imbalances partly reflect the dangers created by competition in credit markets.', 'Even before the 2008 global financial crisis, China‚Äôs annual investment/GDP ratio was running at an exceptionally high 40%, and economists were calling for a transition to more consumption-led growth.', 'But the huge credit stimulus introduced in 2009 drove the economy further in the opposite direction.', 'The investment ratio rose to 47% by 2012, and construction now accounts for 30% of all output.', 'Total credit has risen from 130% of GDP to 200%, with both bank loans and ‚Äúshadow bank‚Äù credit expanding rapidly.', 'Both China and the global economy benefited from that stimulus, which helped prop up overall demand in dangerously deflationary times.', 'But it has led to significant wasted investment in heavy industry, real estate, and urban infrastructure, and leaves China facing the challenge of deleveraging and working out bad debts.', 'In many areas, improved market discipline does have an important role to play in addressing the structural causes of imbalance.', 'Wasteful construction investment is encouraged by the under-pricing of rural land.', 'The lack of a normal ownership relationship between the central government and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) allows the latter to pay minimal dividends and over-invest in business expansion.', 'Caps on interest rates on bank deposits result in household savers supplying a large subsidy to corporate borrowers.', 'And SOEs have better access to credit from state-owned banks than private companies do.', 'But the belief that financial liberalization will provide an easy route to a balanced and stable economy is a delusion, as Japan‚Äôs experience in the 1980‚Äôs illustrates.', 'As Joe Studwell argues persuasively in his book How Asia Works, neither Japan nor South Korea based its successful economic development on free markets in credit supply; instead, they relied on the deliberate direction of credit toward industrial development rather than real estate or consumption.', 'When Japan relaxed constraints on its banking system in the 1980‚Äôs, the result was an enormous real-estate boom and subsequent bust, followed by two decades of slow growth and deflation.', 'China‚Äôs per capita income is still only about a quarter of Japan‚Äôs in 1990; it would be a tragedy if it suffered a similar setback before completing the path to developed-country living standards.', 'One striking feature of the Chinese economy, however, is that real estate and urban infrastructure development ‚Äì high-rise housing, grand transport projects, convention centers, sports stadiums, and museums ‚Äì already play a far more important role than they did in Japan and South Korea at comparable stages of economic development.', 'This reflects the interaction of two distinctively Chinese factors and one inherent feature of all banking systems.', 'The first Chinese factor is the authorities‚Äô focus on ‚Äúurbanization‚Äù as an end in itself, rather than as a byproduct of industrialization.', 'The second is China‚Äôs decentralized approach to economic development, with strong competition between regions and cities often focusing on prestige urban infrastructure projects.', 'The universal feature in this mix is the fact that banks everywhere can create private credit, money, and purchasing power that did not previously exist, and they have a natural bias, if not constrained by public policy, to allocate it to fund real-estate developments, which drive rising land prices.', 'These factors will drive construction booms and busts even if obvious market distortions are removed and market discipline is tightened.', 'The pre-crisis Irish and Spanish banking systems proved just as capable as Chinese state-owned banks at funding excessive real-estate construction.', 'So, even as China introduces greater market discipline to a largely positive effect, it must plan to constrain credit creation with policy tools that were missing in the advanced economies before the 2008 crisis.', 'Caps on loan-to-value or loan-to-income ratios on real-estate loans should be used aggressively.', 'Capital requirements for banks should reflect higher risk weights for real-estate lending than banks‚Äô private assessments of credit risks suggest are appropriate.', 'The People‚Äôs Bank of China should maintain reserve requirements for commercial banks to contain credit creation, rather than reject them as old-fashioned, as occurred in the advanced economies in the decades before 2008.', 'Credit provision by shadow banks needs to be tightly regulated.', 'The credit cycle is too important to be left to free markets.', 'China thus faces a difficult challenge.', 'It must undergo a transition not to the Western model that produced the 2008 crisis, but to an entirely new model that combines elements of market discipline with strong public-policy constraints.', 'How smoothly that transition occurs matters for the whole world.', 'By the early 2020‚Äôs, China‚Äôs GDP will be $20 trillion.', 'If the credit/GDP ratio reaches 250% by then, total loans and debt securities would equal $50 trillion, which is more than three times the total of US mortgage debt in 2008.', 'Today, much of that debt represents claims within the state sector ‚Äì owed, for instance, by SOEs to state-owned banks.', 'But, as the private sector develops, SOEs are subjected to hard budget constraints, and the external capital account is opened, this huge credit mountain will create increasing global financial vulnerability.', 'One hopes that the Chinese authorities understand the dangers as well as the benefits of free financial markets better than advanced-economy policymakers did ahead of the 2008 crisis.', 'If not, another crisis ‚Äì far more severe than the last ‚Äì may become inevitable.', '', 'The Great Credit Mistake', 'LONDON ‚Äì Before the financial crisis erupted in 2008, private credit in most developed economies grew faster than GDP.', 'Then credit growth collapsed.', 'Whether that fall reflected low demand for credit or constrained supply may seem like a technical issue.', 'But the answer holds important implications for policymaking and prospects for economic growth.', 'And the official answer is probably wrong.', 'The prevailing view has usually stressed supply constraints and the policies needed to fix them.', 'An impaired banking system, it is argued, starves businesses, particularly small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), of the funds they need to expand.', 'In September 2008, US President George W. Bush wanted to ‚Äúfree up banks to resume the flow of credit to American families and businesses.‚Äù', 'The stress tests and recapitalizations of US banks in 2009 were subsequently hailed as crucial to the recovery of both the banking system and the economy.', 'By contrast, the European Central Bank‚Äôs inadequately tough stress tests in 2010 were widely panned for leaving eurozone banks too weak to provide adequate credit.', 'In the United Kingdom, banks have been criticized for not lending the reserves created by quantitative easing to the real economy, leading the Bank of England to introduce its ‚Äúfunding for lending‚Äù scheme in 2012.', 'In the eurozone, it is hoped that this year‚Äôs asset quality review (AQR) and stress tests will finally dispel concerns about bank solvency and free up credit supply.', 'A ‚Äúcredit crunch‚Äù ‚Äì particularly in trade finance ‚Äì was certainly a key reason why the financial crisis generated a real economy recession.', 'Taxpayer-funded bank rescues, higher bank capital requirements, and ultra-easy monetary policy have all been vital to overcome credit supply constraints.', 'But there is strong evidence that once the immediate crisis was over, lack of demand for credit played a far larger role than restricted supply in impeding economic growth.', 'That argument is persuasively made by Atif Mian and Amir Sufi in House of Debt, an important new book that analyzes US data on a county-by-county basis.', 'Mian and Sufi show that the recession was caused by a collapse of household consumption, and that consumption fell most in those counties where pre-crisis borrowing and post-crisis real-estate prices left households facing the largest relative losses in net wealth.', 'It was in those US counties, too, that local businesses cut employment most aggressively.', 'For SMEs, a shortage of customers, not a shortage of credit, constrained borrowing, employment, and output.', 'And the customers were absent because the pre-crisis credit boom had left them over-leveraged.', 'In the UK, many business surveys from 2009-2012 told the same story.', 'Poor customer demand was ranked well ahead of credit availability as a constraint on growth.', 'Economic growth can indeed continue to be severely depressed by a debt overhang even when credit supply is unrestricted and cheap.', 'Many Japanese companies were left overleveraged by the boom and bust in credit and real estate in the 1980s and early 1990s.', 'By the late 1990s, the Japanese banking system was offering companies loans at near-zero interest rates.', 'But, rather than borrow to invest, firms cut investment to pay down debt, driving two decades of stagnation and deflation.', 'Since 2011, the ECB‚Äôs analysis of weak eurozone growth has stressed the negative impact of an impaired and fragmented financial system, with high sovereign-bond yields and funding costs for banks resulting in prohibitive lending terms in the peripheral countries.', 'Major progress in fixing these problems has already been achieved.', 'The ECB‚Äôs latest Monthly Bulletin documents this, citing multiple indicators of improved credit availability and pricing.', 'Nonetheless, the rate of decline in private-sector loans has accelerated over the last year ‚Äì from -0.6% to -2% ‚Äì and low demand is acknowledged to be the main driver of depressed credit growth.', 'Simultaneous private deleveraging and fiscal consolidation are restricting eurozone growth far more than remaining restrictions on credit supply.', 'Despite the ECB‚Äôs own evidence, however, the policy focus remains on fixing the credit-supply problem, through the AQR and stress tests, and through the ECB‚Äôs own version of a funding for lending scheme, announced on June 5.', 'That reflects a recurring tendency in official policy debates, particularly in the eurozone, to concentrate on fixable problems to the exclusion of more difficult issues.', 'Fixing impaired banking systems after a crisis is both essential and achievable.', 'Moreover, even when public rescue costs are inevitable, they are typically small change compared to the economic harm wrought by the financial crisis and post-crisis recession.', 'By contrast, a large debt overhang may be intractable unless policy orthodoxies are challenged.', 'Japan offset private deleveraging in the 1990s by running massive public deficits.', 'The US has pulled out of recession faster than the eurozone, not only ‚Äì or even primarily ‚Äì because it fixed its banking system faster, but because it pursued more stimulative fiscal policies.', 'But fiscal stimulus is constrained within the eurozone, where member countries no longer issue their own currency and ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù debt therefore carries a default risk.', 'Aggressive monetary expansion through quantitative easing is also far more complicated and politically contentious in a currency area with no federal debt for the central bank to buy.', 'To survive and thrive, the eurozone will need to become more centralized, with some common fiscal revenues, expenditures, and debts.', 'Of course, this scenario implies immensely difficult political choices.', 'But the starting point for debate must be realism about the nature and severity of the problems facing the eurozone.', 'If eurozone policy assumes that fixing the banks will fix the economy, the next ten years in Europe could look like the 1990s in Japan.', '', 'Inequality by the Click', 'LONDON ‚Äì Pope Francis warned in November that ‚Äúideologies which defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace‚Äù are driving rapid growth in inequality.', 'Is he right?', 'In one sense, Francis was clearly wrong: in many cases, inequality between countries is decreasing.', 'The average Chinese household, for example, is now catching up with the average American household (though still with a long way to go).', 'But such examples do not negate the importance of rising inequality within countries.', 'Both China and the United States are dramatically unequal societies ‚Äì and are becoming more so.', 'In the US, the statistics are striking at both ends of the income distribution.', 'The bottom quarter of US households have received almost no increase in real (inflation-adjusted) income for the last 25 years.', 'They are no longer sharing the fruits of their country‚Äôs growth.', 'The top 1% of Americans, however, have seen their real incomes almost triple during this period, with their share of national income reaching 20%, a figure not seen since the 1920‚Äôs.', 'In many emerging countries, rapid economic growth has raised living standards to at least some degree for almost everyone, but the share of the rich and ultra-rich is increasing dramatically.', 'Once these countries approach the average income levels of developed economies, and their growth slows to typical rich-country rates, their future may look like America today.', 'Globalization explains some of the bottom-quarter income stagnation in the US and other developed economies.', 'Competition from lower-paid Chinese workers has driven down US wages.', 'But technological change may be a more fundamental factor ‚Äì and one with consequences for all countries.', 'Technological change is the essence of economic growth.', 'We get richer because we figure out how to maintain or increase output with fewer employees, and because innovation creates new products and services.', 'Successful new technologies always cause job losses in some sectors, which are offset by new jobs elsewhere.', 'Tractors destroyed millions of agricultural jobs, for example, but tractor, truck, and car manufacturers created millions of new ones.', 'But new technologies come in subtly different forms, with inherently different economic consequences.', 'Today‚Äôs new technologies may have far more troubling distributional effects than those of the electromechanical age.', 'Imagine that 30 years ago, someone had discovered a set of magic words enabling us to speak to any friend anywhere in the world ‚Äì ‚Äúabracadabra John‚Äù and you were talking to John, wherever he was.', 'Provided she secured intellectual-property rights, the inventor would have become the richest person in the world; and her lawyers and those who provided her with luxury goods and services would have become pretty rich, too.', 'But, beyond that, no new jobs would have been created.', 'Information and communication technology is not costless magic; but it is closer to it than were the innovations of the electromechanical age.', 'The cost of computing hardware collapses over time in line with Moore‚Äôs law of relentlessly increasing processing power.', 'And once software has been developed, the marginal cost of copying it is effectively zero.', 'The consumer benefits of this technology are large relative to its price: the cost of each year‚Äôs latest computer, tablet, or smartphone is trivial compared to the cost of a new car in 1950.', 'But the number of jobs created is trivial, too.', 'In 1979, General Motors employed 850,000 workers.', 'Today, Microsoft employs only 100,000 people worldwide, Google employs 50,000, and Facebook employs just 5,000.', 'These are mere drops in the ocean of the global labor market, replacing very few of the jobs that information technology has automated away.', 'But increased unemployment is not inevitable.', 'There is no limit to the number of service jobs that we can create in retail, restaurants and catering, hotels, and an enormous variety of personal services.', 'Walmart, for example, employs two million people, and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that more than one million additional jobs will be created in America‚Äôs leisure and hospitality sector in the next decade.', 'But the wages that the market will set for these jobs may result in yet greater inequality.', 'And there is no reason to believe that politicians‚Äô all-purpose answer to the problem ‚Äì ‚Äúincrease workforce skills‚Äù ‚Äì will offset this tendency.', 'However many people learn superior IT skills, Facebook will never need more than a few thousand employees.', 'And access to high-paid jobs is likely to be determined not by absolute skill level, but by relative skill in a winner-take-all world.', 'At least, however, IT products and services are very cheap, so even the relatively poor can afford them.', 'That might make very unequal societies more stable than many fear.', 'In his recent book Average is Over, the economist Tyler Cowen makes the deliberately provocative argument that while new technology will produce extreme inequality, the relative losers, satiated by computer games and Internet entertainment, and provided with the basics of a minimally acceptable life, will be too docile to revolt.', 'Cowen may be right; the poor may not rebel.', 'But extreme inequality should still concern us.', 'Beyond a certain point, unequal outcomes inevitably fuel greater inequality of opportunity; and extreme inequality of either outcomes or opportunity can undermine the idea that we should all be equal as citizens, if not in material standard of living.', 'So Pope Francis was right: despite capitalism‚Äôs undoubted success as a system for generating economic growth, we cannot rely on market forces alone to generate desirable social outcomes.', 'All new technologies create opportunities, but free markets will distribute the fruits of some new technologies in dramatically unequal ways.', 'Offsetting such outcomes will be a greater challenge today than it has been in the past.', '', 'Protectionist Shadows over Solar Power', 'CAMBRIDGE ‚Äì As July ended, a settlement was reached in the world‚Äôs largest anti-dumping dispute, with China agreeing to a minimum price for the solar panels that it exports to the European Union.', 'The solution is much less severe than what had been the imminent alternative: EU tariffs on Chinese solar panels were set to rise to 47.6%, as a result of the European Commission‚Äôs ‚Äúfinding‚Äù that China ‚Äì whose market share now stands at 80% in Europe ‚Äì had been ‚Äúdumping.‚Äù', 'Nonetheless, the settlement is a bad outcome for consumers ‚Äì and for the environment.', 'The China-EU dispute parallels a similar one between China and the United States.', 'Last fall, the US introduced tariffs of 24-36% against Chinese solar-panel imports, after the Commerce Department determined that China had been ‚Äúdumping‚Äù ‚Äì which is generally defined as selling at a price below cost ‚Äì into the American market.', 'China, citing its own finding of US dumping of polysilicon ‚Äì a key input in the production of solar panels ‚Äì into its market, has already retaliated by imposing import tariffs that could exceed 50%.', 'The solar-panel disputes may sound narrow and esoteric, but they go to the heart of the long-running debate over globalization.', 'Anti-globalization activists‚Äô most powerful argument is that even if free trade is good for economic progress overall, it might undermine important public goods such as environmental protection.', 'Under the well-known ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù hypothesis, countries that are open to international trade are thought to adopt weaker environmental regulations than less open countries do.', 'But trade can also have beneficial environmental effects.', 'Specialization in each country allows people to obtain more of what they want, which, especially at higher income levels, includes cleaner air and water.', 'When trade brings down costs, it can benefit environmental goods just as much as it benefits other goods.', 'So, is trade globalization, on balance, better or worse for the environment?', 'Some empirical studies of cross-country data find net beneficial effects on indicators of environmental degradation like local sulfur-dioxide air pollution.', 'Provided that countries have effective governance institutions at the national level, trade and growth give them the means to clean their air.', 'But the evidence also suggests that trade and growth can exacerbate other forms of environmental degradation, particularly carbon-dioxide emissions, because CO2 is a global externality that cannot be addressed at the national level, owing to the free-rider problem.', 'The solar-power industry is a perfect example of how trade can benefit air quality.', 'Skeptics of solar power have long argued that its share in electricity generation cannot rise above a few percentage points without massive subsidies, because it is too costly compared to the alternatives.', 'Proponents, for their part, counter that temporary moderate subsidies would expand the industry, with economies of scale and learning-by-doing then bringing down costs sharply.', 'But proponents have focused too much on government subsidies and too little on the contribution of international trade, which in recent years has had a highly positive effect on the development of solar power, as the bonanza of Chinese panels held down costs.', 'The current embrace of protectionism threatens to reverse this progress.', 'With the loss of cheap solar panels from China, and with subsidies that helped to drive the European industry now reduced for fiscal reasons, the share of solar power in Europe will fall far short of environmentalists‚Äô goals.', 'But ‚Äúfindings‚Äù of ‚Äúdumping‚Äù into foreign markets surely warrant some response, no?', 'Actually, no.', 'For starters, even those who are generally sympathetic to trade and markets often have the impression that anti-dumping laws target ‚Äúpredatory pricing,‚Äù a practice in which a large producer sells below cost in order to drive its competitors into bankruptcy, at which point it can raise the price and reap monopoly profits.', 'But that is not even the way anti-dumping laws are usually written, let alone applied.', 'Simply put, anti-dumping measures, such as the US and EU tariffs against Chinese solar panels, are a means of reducing, not fostering, competition.', 'So, if predatory pricing is not the producers‚Äô motive for selling below cost in these cases, what is?', 'The solar-panel industry worldwide ‚Äì in China, Europe, and the US ‚Äì is experiencing a glut of productive capacity.', 'As a result, global supply and demand are balanced at a market price that is below the long-term average cost per unit, which includes a share of the cost already incurred in building the factories.', 'But that market price is not below the short-term cost of keeping the factories running once they are built.', 'In other words, producers sell at prices that are ‚Äúbelow cost,‚Äù because, having already built the factories, they would lose even more money if they charged above the competitive market price or shut down production altogether.', 'When the US or EU finds that China is ‚Äúdumping‚Äù solar panels, or when China finds that the US is ‚Äúdumping‚Äù polysilicon, they are using average cost rather than marginal cost.', 'By this criterion, dumping occurs every time a store has a clearance sale.', 'Some have compared the negotiated agreements to limit China‚Äôs solar-panel exports to past ‚Äúvoluntary export restraints‚Äù (VERs) or ‚Äúorderly marketing arrangements‚Äù in the steel and consumer-electronic industries, especially those that Japan agreed to apply to its exports to the US in the 1980‚Äôs.', 'But a more revealing precedent is Japan‚Äôs VERs on exports of autos during this period.', 'American automakers had found it increasingly difficult to compete against smaller, more fuel-efficient Japanese imports.', 'When free trade was eventually restored, American wallets and air quality benefited (and the US auto industry was forced to become more efficient).', 'Free trade in automobiles was good for the environment 30 years ago.', 'The same is true of trade in solar equipment today.', 'Westerners should thank Chinese panel producers for their contribution to keeping solar power viable, not penalize them through

Global Commission on Adaptation, chaired by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva.', 'Over the next 15 years, the world will need to invest some $90 trillion in infrastructure improvements.', 'How these projects proceed, and whether they are designed with low-carbon features, could lead the world toward a more-climate resilient future ‚Äì or they could undermine food, water, and security for decades to come.', '', 'Adapting to Climate Change', 'COPENHAGEN ‚Äì Striking the right balance between preventing global warming and adapting to its effects is one of the most important ‚Äì and most vexing ‚Äì policy questions of our age.', 'It is also often ignored.', 'According to the conventional wisdom of many environmental campaigners, we should first do everything we can to mitigate global warming, and only then focus on adaptation strategies.', 'This seems wrong ‚Äì even immoral ‚Äì if we could do more for people and the planet through adaptation.', 'Moreover, it is inconsistent with the inescapable fact that, whatever we do, we cannot prevent all of global warming‚Äôs effects.', 'If we are ill-prepared, global warming will cause more deaths and devastation, especially in poor countries and fragile societies.', 'Adaptation would also mean saving many lives from catastrophes not related to global warming.', 'If we prepare societies for more ferocious hurricanes in the future, for example, we are also helping them to cope better with today‚Äôs extreme weather.', 'There has been a huge amount of research into the ways that humans cause climate change, and how we can reduce it.', 'Much less work has been devoted to adaptation.', 'It is important to acknowledge that some adaptation strategies will lead to more greenhouse-gas emissions.', 'Responding to water scarcity by re-using and treating wastewater, or through deep-well pumping and desalination, will increase fossil-fuel use.', 'Using more air-conditioning to cool our houses in summer will do the same ‚Äì although this is vital if we want to save lives.', 'Adaptation could allow for higher carbon emissions in another way: reducing the damage and harm that we experience from global warming, giving us more time to implement alternatives to reliance on fossil fuels.', 'Should any of this stop us from using adaptation strategies?', 'To arrive at an informed answer, we need to work out how the planet will look in 2100 if we invest different amounts in adaptation and carbon cuts.', 'We need to take into account the increase in emissions that adaptation will cause.', 'The most critical issue isn‚Äôt any rise or fall in emissions.', 'It is how much climate damage we can avoid.', 'How much of the planet can we help by dealing with rising sea levels?', 'How many lives can we spare from heat, starvation, or malaria?', 'These are the real reasons we care about global warming.', 'Reaching a proper answer to these questions requires extensive economic modeling, with different variables calculated and regional differences analyzed.', 'New research by three Italian economists, Francesco Bosello, Carlo Carraro, and Enrica De Cian does this, and, ultimately, provides a powerful economic case for a much greater focus on adaptation.', 'They first look at the different ways that climate change will affect us at mid-century.', 'This work is based on standard scenarios, and carries the typical caveats of predictions far into the future.', 'Nevertheless, they find that many of our biggest concerns will turn out to be trivial, or even beneficial.', 'Sea-level rises will be a very minor concern for every country, with the financial impact adding up to less than 0.1% of GDP.', 'Health problems will be negligible for all but a few nations.', 'And global warming‚Äôs impact would reduce energy consumption for almost all nations.', 'The important effects are on agriculture and tourism, where nations will lose, on average, about 0.5% of GDP from each sector.', 'But much of this damage will be avoided by people choosing for themselves to adapt to a change in their environment.', 'Farmers will choose plants that thrive in heat.', 'New houses will be designed to deal with warmer temperatures.', 'Simple economic models, often quoted in the media, show that unconstrained global warming would cost a substantial 2% of GDP in the rich world by the end of the century.', 'But this fails to acknowledge that people will change their behavior when the environment changes.', 'Taking adaptation into account, rich countries will adapt to the negative consequences of global warming and exploit the positive changes, creating a total positive effect of global warming worth about 0.1% of GDP.', 'Poor countries will be hit harder, however.', 'Adaptation will reduce the climate change-related losses from 5% of GDP to slightly less than 3% ‚Äì but this is still a significant impact.', 'The real challenge of global warming, therefore, lies in tackling its impact on the Third World.', 'Here, more needs to be done, above and beyond the adaptation that will happen naturally.', 'Importantly, the new research shows that adaptation would achieve a lot more than cuts in carbon emissions.', 'Reducing emissions to a level that does not extinguish economic growth could avert $3 trillion worth of damage, whereas adaptation could prevent around $8 trillion worth of damage.', 'For every dollar spent on adaptation, we would achieve about $1.70 worth of positive changes for the planet.', 'The economic case for focusing more on adaptation is clear.', 'The crucial next step is to ensure that economic arguments become a stronger part of our political debate about how to address global warming.', '', 'Adapt or Die', 'MILAN ‚Äì In rapidly growing emerging markets, a combination of internal economic forces, supportive policies, and the shifting nature of the global economy drive high-speed and far-reaching change.', 'The transformation of economic structures occurs so quickly that it is virtually impossible not to notice ‚Äì though the complexity of the change is, at times, bewildering.', 'In this fluid environment, mistakes are frequently made.', 'Arguably the most damaging is to stick to a successful growth strategy (a combination of comparative advantage and supportive policies) for too long.', 'In the economy‚Äôs tradable sector, comparative advantage always shifts, causing structural change and creative destruction.', 'Countries undergoing a ‚Äúmiddle-income transition‚Äù out of poor-country status frequently try to resist these changes, but doing so causes growth to slow, if not stop altogether.', 'While the private sector (domestic and external) drives these shifts, government policies and public-sector investment patterns play an essential supporting and complementary role.', 'These need to adapt, too.', 'The policy framework that has proven to serve the major emerging economies best is one that focuses not only on macro and monetary stability, but also on adaptation, guided by a forward-looking (though inherently imperfect) assessment of coming micro and macro structural shifts and the measures needed to support them.', 'What of the large advanced countries?', 'For historical reasons, the policy mindset is less flexible and adaptive.', 'Structural change is viewed largely as the province of the private sector, and hence not as a key part of long-term policy thinking.', 'In the postwar period, until recently, advanced economies dominated the global economy.', 'Emerging economies‚Äô impact on them was relatively small, and they have yet to respond adequately to the rapid structural changes in the global economy.', 'A small example: as recently as July 8, after the latest disappointing employment report in the United States, President Barack Obama expressed the widely held view that an agreement on the debt ceiling and deficit reduction would remove the uncertainty that is holding back business investment, growth, and employment.', 'In other words, America‚Äôs fiscal problems explain its extremely weak economic recovery.', 'Once a fiscal deal is done, government can step aside and let the private sector drive the structural changes that are needed to restore a pattern of inclusive growth.', 'To be fair, there have been exceptions to this stance.', 'In the US, a postwar alliance of government, business, and academia created the human capital and technology base of a dynamic economy, reinforced by the post-Sputnik commitment to scientific and technological excellence and innovation.', 'In Germany, the post-2000 reforms that reset the economy‚Äôs productivity, flexibility, and competitiveness have proved crucial to the country‚Äôs current economic strength and resilience.', 'Despite these examples, economic and financial commentators appear increasingly puzzled about the weak US recovery, with its modest GDP growth and meager employment gains.', 'Growth estimates since the 2008 crisis have been revised downward several times.', 'The political narrative runs in parallel.', 'A recent (admittedly partisan) study by the US Congress‚Äôs Joint Economic Committee documents the relative weakness of the current recovery.', 'Indeed, the differences between the current situation and other postwar US recoveries are so large that the term ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù in today‚Äôs context is dubious.', 'But US leaders nonetheless accept the cyclical view of the economy, see a weak recovery, and blame it on post-crisis policy failures.', 'But, while that might play well politically, the sensible conclusion is that this is not just a cyclical recovery, but rather the beginning of a delayed process of structural adaptation to a rapidly shifting global economy, to emerging economies‚Äô growth and shifting comparative advantage, and to powerful technological forces.', 'While these changes are difficult to think about with any degree of precision, that doesn‚Äôt make them unimportant.', 'Of course, no one would deny that there are cyclical elements in the downturn of 2008.', 'But they were accompanied by structural imbalances that had been building over at least 15 years, and that are at the heart of the US economy‚Äôs inability to bounce back in a normal cyclical way.', 'Skeptics might well question why, if these alleged structural imbalances are now impeding GDP and employment growth, they did not appear before the crisis.', 'The answer is that they did, but not in growth and employment figures.', 'Other signals were missed, ignored, or deemed unimportant.', 'A short list of these signals would include excess consumption (now gone) and deficient savings, based on an asset bubble and high debt; a persistent and growing current-account deficit (signaling that domestic consumption and investment exceeded income and output); and negligible net employment growth (over two decades) in the economy‚Äôs tradable sector.', 'With domestic aggregate demand in short supply, the only functioning growth engine, external trade in goods and services, is not an employment engine.', 'Missing all of these signals produced the pre-crisis illusion of sustainable growth and employment, and helps explain why the crisis, rather than its causes, is viewed as the culprit.', 'The crisis, however, merely exposed the underlying imbalances and unwound some of them.', 'The ‚Äúgrand bargain‚Äù that PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian recently alluded to in describing the appropriate response to the current situation in the US needs to include a fiscal stabilization plan.', 'But it also must include a shift to a policy framework that accurately reflects the non-cyclical nature of the longer-term structural adaptations that will be required to restore growth and employment.', '', 'A Daughter of Dictatorship and Democracy', 'SEOUL ‚Äì It is something of a clich√© question in South Korea nowadays: Who would be the country‚Äôs next president if the election were held tomorrow, rather than in December 2012?', 'Numerous opinion polls show Park Geun-hye of the ruling Grand National Party (GNP) to be the leading candidate.', 'If elected, she would be South Korea‚Äôs first woman president, and, for her rivals, her dominant position in the race is an uncomfortable but unassailable fact.', 'South Korean voters of all ages and regions have welcomed Park as a candidate for their country‚Äôs leadership.', 'Her political style is both refreshing and relevant, because she comes across as sincere and forthright at a time when the public is hungry for moral leadership.', 'And she has an astonishing talent for simplifying complicated issues accurately, which she likely learned ‚Äì along with how to interpret and manipulate the political connotations of every issue ‚Äì from her father, former President Park Chung-hee.', 'Acclaimed as a national hero among radical right-wingers, the iron-fisted Park Chung-hee ruled South Korea from 1963 to 1979, in the wake of the 1961 military coup, only to be assassinated by his intelligence chief.', 'His daughter is proud of his legacy, which marked the beginning of South Korea‚Äôs economic boom.', 'Indeed, as a pillar of export-oriented modernity, Park Chung-hee was once lionized as the archetype of a modernizing political leadership in military-authoritarian states.', 'At home, he still ranks first in popularity among the country‚Äôs heads of state, kindling nostalgia like a popular old record ‚Äì a corollary to people‚Äôs frustration and anger at the current government of President Lee Myung-bak.', 'Park, who lost her first bid for the GNP‚Äôs nomination to Lee in 2007, needs to ensure that no rupture with her erstwhile rival knocks her off the path to victory in 2012.', 'An astute politician, Park did not hesitate to campaign wholeheartedly for Lee the last time around ‚Äì a move that, as part of long-term political strategy, made perfect sense.', 'To many South Koreans, the election is now Park‚Äôs to lose.', 'No candidate on the horizon seems able to stop her.', 'If she wins, it will be the result of her seriousness and tenacity, not her political heritage.', 'No one in South Korea‚Äôs conservative movement doubts that Park is one of them.', 'And, as an icon of the right, she is well aware that she cannot afford to betray her status.', 'Despite her charisma, Park is neither a Sarah Palin nor an Eva Peron.', 'Indeed, she looks more like a Korean Margaret Thatcher ‚Äì a lady not for turning, in Thatcher‚Äôs famous phrase, and with clearly thought-through political principles animating her actions.', 'In any case, she seems destined to establish a new South Korea focusing on her landmark pledge ‚Äòjul pu se,‚Äô literally meaning ‚Äòreduce-loosen-strengthen tax-cuts,‚Äô deregulation, and law and order, not just to add another chapter to her father‚Äôs old book.', 'Her administration would mark a fresh departure from the country‚Äôs troubled recent past.', 'Left-leaning pundits claim that the dictator‚Äôs daughter has the same autocratic vision as her father, though Park invariably prefers incremental change to radical measures, and cut her political teeth in the tough-minded politics of the GNP.', 'Others take a flagrantly sexist stance, arguing that a woman president would be a non-starter as long as the North Korean regime continues to threaten national security.', 'Although these criticisms don‚Äôt seem to bother the electorate very much, Park‚Äôs path to victory may yet prove narrower than her supporters expect.', 'She has been called the ‚ÄúQueen of Elections,‚Äù in particular since she won a campaign in 2006 after being slashed with a box cutter by a deranged man.', 'But she must convincingly outline practical strategies to resolve South Korea‚Äôs most serious problems, including high unemployment, worsening educational performance, and North Korea‚Äôs nuclear weapons program.', 'Ms. Park once pledged to provide loans for working-class families from elementary school to college years, while contending that local universities should be empowered to have more autonomy.', 'She favors engagement policy and the six-party talks so as to resolve the nuclear troubles.', 'Come presidential election-day in 2012, South Korean voters will pick the candidate who embodies pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue.', 'Park‚Äôs success will depend, in the end, on the effectiveness of her campaign in further defining her character along those lines.', 'Unlike former Peruvian dictator Alberto Fujimori‚Äôs daughter, who lost her presidential bid in Peru last month, Park is likely to defy her family‚Äôs tragic history.', 'If she does, she will be Asia‚Äôs most powerful woman, perhaps the most powerful in the world, at the end of next year.', '', 'A Day for Planetary Justice', 'PRINCETON ‚Äì What we are doing to our planet, to our children and grandchildren, and to the poor, by our heedless production of greenhouse gases, is one of the great moral wrongs of our age.', 'On October 24, you can stand up against this injustice.', 'October 24 is 350 Day.', 'The name comes from the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that, according to Jim Hansen, perhaps the world‚Äôs leading climate scientist, we should not exceed if we are to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change.', 'It is a measure of the seriousness of our problem that CO2 is already at 386 ppm, and is rising by two ppm each year.', 'The need to cut greenhouse gases has become increasingly clear as predictions of global warming ‚Äì denounced as ‚Äúalarmist‚Äù when they were first made just a few years ago ‚Äì have repeatedly turned out to have been too conservative.', 'We are approaching a point of no return, at which feedback loops will kick in and continue to warm the planet, no matter what we do.', 'The melting of arctic ice is one example.', 'Four hundred years ago, explorers sought the legendary ‚ÄúNortheast Passage‚Äù across the north of Europe and Russia to China.', 'They found the arctic ice impenetrable, and soon gave up their quest.', 'This year, commercial vessels successfully navigated the Northeast Passage.', 'That is one of many recent dramatic signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is warmer than it has been for a very long time.', 'But ice-free arctic waters are more than a symptom of global warming.', 'They are themselves a cause of further warming: ice and snow reflect the sun‚Äôs rays.', 'An ice-free surface absorbs more warmth from the sun than one covered in snow or ice. In other words, our greenhouse gas emissions have, by causing enough warming to melt the arctic ice, created a feedback loop that will generate more warming, and melt more ice, even if we were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases tomorrow.', 'Other feedback loops pose a similar danger.', 'In Siberia, vast quantities of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, are locked up in what used to be called ‚Äúpermafrost‚Äù ‚Äì regions in which it was assumed that the ground was permanently frozen.', 'But areas that used to be frozen are now thawing, releasing methane and thus contributing to further warming ‚Äì and to further thawing, which releases more methane.', 'Developing nations are grasping just how outrageous the current distribution of greenhouse-gas emissions really is.', 'At the United Nations Summit on Climate Change in September, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda pointed out that, while developed nations outside Africa are almost entirely responsible for the problem, its greatest impact will probably be on Africa, which has few resources to cope with the challenge.', 'Kagame then suggested giving every country an annual per capita quota for CO2 emissions, and allowing developing countries that are below the quota to trade their excess quota with countries that are above theirs.', 'The money that developing countries would receive for this would not be aid, but rather a recognition that the rich nations must pay for something that in the past they simply appropriated: far more than their fair share of our atmosphere‚Äôs capacity to absorb our waste gases.', 'Sri Lanka took a similar stance, using studies from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to calculate that in 2008, environmentally permissible carbon emissions totaled no more than 2,172 kilograms per person.', 'In fact, the world‚Äôs per capita emissions were 4,700 kilograms, or more than double the permissible limit.', 'But, while emissions in the rich nations were far above the permissible limit, Sri Lankan emissions were, at 660 kilograms, well below it.', 'As Sri Lanka‚Äôs government pointed out, ‚ÄúThat means low-emitting countries like us could not emit more because our space has already been exploited by developed or global heavy polluting countries without our consent.‚Äù', 'This situation is an injustice of vast proportions, reminiscent of ‚Äì and arguably much worse than ‚Äì the now-repudiated colonialism of the Western powers in the nineteenth century.', 'The task of remedying it must begin at the meeting on climate change that will be held in Copenhagen in December.', 'Many political leaders have expressed support for strong action on climate change, but what most of them regard as ‚Äústrong action‚Äù will not be enough to get us back below 350 ppm.', 'In some countries, including the United States, there are major political obstacles to taking even modest steps.', 'On October 24, people in nearly every country will be taking action to raise awareness of the need for an international treaty to bring our atmosphere back to 350 ppm of CO2.', 'There will be climbers hanging banners high in the Himalayas, where the glaciers are melting, and scuba divers at Australia‚Äôs Great Barrier Reef, which is threatened by climate change.', 'Churches will ring bells 350 times, 350 cyclists will circle towns, and, in many places, 350 trees will be planted.', 'At www.350.org you can find out what is happening near you and join in, or put your own idea online.', 'But don‚Äôt just sit back and hope that others will do enough to make an impact.', 'One day your grandchildren will ask you: what did you do to meet the greatest moral challenge of your time?', '', 'A Day of Liberation', 'When I was seven years old, in 1960, my grandmother Angelica opened my eyes to the meaning of 8 May 1945, the day when Nazi Germany surrendered and World War II ended in Europe.', 'We were spending our summer holidays in Normandy where the liberation of Europe from Nazism had started on D-Day, 6 June 1944.', 'One evening, I listened to my parents and my grandmother talking about the past.', 'I have forgotten the details of their conversation, but I can still hear my grandmother‚Äôs sigh of relief when she said ‚ÄúThank God we lost that war!‚Äù', 'From a child‚Äôs perspective, it wasn‚Äôt self-evident that losing was a good thing.', 'But of course, my grandmother was right to equate defeat with liberation.', 'The more I have thought about the lesson she taught me 45 years ago, the clearer I have seen another, less obvious dimension in what she said: It is ‚Äúwe‚Äù who lost the war.', 'Collectively, the Germans had not been the innocent victims of a small gang of criminal outsiders called ‚ÄúNazis‚Äù ‚Äì Nazism had been an inside ideology supported by millions of Germans, and every German was liable for its atrocities whether or not he or she had adhered to it individually.', 'In today‚Äôs Germany, an overwhelming majority subscribes to the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation ‚Äì not only for Europe, but also for Germany itself.', 'Compared to public opinion in 1960, that‚Äôs certainly an enormous progress.', 'But paradoxically, it may also contain an element of forgetfulness, because it tends to conceal the fact that liberation required a military defeat.', 'To use my grandmother‚Äôs parlance, it is not ‚Äúus‚Äù who were the liberators, but ‚Äúthem‚Äù.', 'The way people see the past tells us more about their present attitudes than about the past itself.', 'This is what the term ‚Äúpolitics of memory‚Äù is meant to indicate.', 'And this is why it doesn‚Äôt matter whether the relevant events happened 60 years ago (as World War II), 90 years (as in the case of the Armenian genocide) or even 600 years (such as the battle of Kosovo in 1389).', 'A violent conflict in the past may survive as a war of memories in the present, as can be observed in the current dispute between China and South Korea on one side, and Japan on the other.', 'A war of memories, in turn, may sometimes lead to a violent conflict in the future.', 'Former perpetrators often try to de-legitimize their former victims‚Äô moral superiority by claiming they were victims themselves.', 'Therefore, the 60th anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden by Allied forces on 13 February 1945 has probably been a more crucial moment in terms of the German ‚Äúpolitics of memory‚Äù than the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945 is going to be.', 'Far-right groups infamously dubbed the attack by which at least 30,000 people were killed ‚ÄúDresden‚Äôs Holocaust of bombs.‚Äù', 'Fortunately, their propaganda campaign has been a failure.', 'Although it is true that thousands of the civilians killed in Dresden and other German cities were innocent at an individual level, there can be no doubt it was morally imperative that Germany be defeated collectively.', 'On the left side of the German political spectrum, the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation remains unchallenged.', 'However, it is sometimes repressed that the massive use of force had been necessary to achieve that result.', 'Left-wing pacifism tends to overlook this simple fact.', 'Its slogan ‚ÄúNever again war!‚Äù is only half the truth ‚Äì the other half is ‚ÄúNever again appeasement!‚Äù', '8 May 1945 was not ‚Äúzero hour,‚Äù as a popular saying in Germany goes.', 'It had an antecedent, that is, a lack of pre-emptive resistance at home and abroad to the threat that built up in Nazi Germany during the 1930‚Äôs.', 'There is yet another lesson to be learned.', 'Yes, 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation to which the Soviet army contributed decisively.', 'But for millions of Central and East Europeans, liberation was followed by Stalin‚Äôs oppressive regime.', 'The current war of memories between the Baltic republics and Russia, with regard to the international celebration in Moscow on 9 May this year, reminds Germany of a special historic responsibility.', 'The German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, the so-called Hitler-Stalin pact, concluded in August 1939, had been supplemented by a secret appendix dividing the border states Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania into spheres of interest for the two parties.', 'But excusing Nazi atrocities by pointing to Stalinist crimes is an intellectually and morally unacceptable stratagem.', 'When Chancellor Schr√∂der travels to Moscow for the Red Square celebrations, he should bear in mind Nazi Germany‚Äôs contribution to the Baltic tragedy.', 'On 8 May this year, public speakers will remind us how important it is not to forget.', 'They will stress that if the lessons of history are not learned, history is bound to repeat itself.', 'All this is perfectly true.', 'But personally, I will also remember my grandmother‚Äôs sentence ‚ÄúThank God we lost that war!‚Äù', 'Thank God ‚Äì and thanks to all those brave Allied soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Europe‚Äôs liberty.', '', 'Crashing the SDR', 'SANTA BARBARA ‚Äì The Chinese government‚Äôs campaign to have its currency, the renminbi, included in the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs reserve asset appears to be on the brink of success.', 'Last week, IMF staff formally recommended adding the renminbi to the basket of currencies that determines the value of its so-called Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).', 'The addition of the renminbi to the basket, which currently includes the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen, would provide China with a boost to its prestige.', 'More important, it would advance the government‚Äôs efforts to internationalize the renminbi.', 'But it would also be a mistake.', 'The decision to recommend the renminbi‚Äôs inclusion, far from having been made on sound economic grounds, can only be understood as political.', 'As such, the long-term consequences are likely to be regrettable.', 'On a purely technical basis, the renminbi‚Äôs qualifications for inclusion in the SDR basket are questionable.', 'Traditionally, the IMF has insisted on two criteria: a currency‚Äôs issuing country must be among the world‚Äôs leading exporters, and the currency must be ‚Äúfreely usable‚Äù ‚Äì widely used and traded.', 'As the world‚Äôs largest exporter, China clearly meets the first condition.', 'The second, however, is probably still beyond its reach.', 'The renminbi is by no means in the same league as the SDR basket‚Äôs four incumbent currencies.', 'In 2014, China‚Äôs currency ranked seventh in global central-bank reserves, eighth in international bond issuance, and 11th in global currency trading.', 'Moreover, the renminbi remains non-convertible for most capital transactions, China‚Äôs financial markets are primitive, and trading margins for the exchange rate are still set daily by the monetary authorities.', 'Indeed, as recently as August, the IMF was skeptical about adding the renminbi to the SDR basket, saying that ‚Äúsignificant work‚Äù was still needed, and suggesting that a decision should be put off until 2016 in order to ensure a ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù transition.']\n"
