@user Pray?? You want me to PRAY that abortions and dangerous facilities remain unchecked?? #facepalm #SemST 
@user I don't either. Why would you want to make people have kids? Esp when they're not prepared? Makes no sense. 
@user @user & yet Amnesty advocates child murder! #SemST 
@user make their own decisions doesn't mean you need to harass me . Goodbye now. #freedom #SemST 
We say God bless America but we kill 4,000 babies a year. #SemST
